# SARIF and GitHub Code Scanning

Stave outputs SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format), which GitHub code scanning consumes natively. Findings appear in the Security tab alongside CodeQL and other scanners.

## Generate SARIF[​](#generate-sarif "Direct link to Generate SARIF")

```
stave apply --observations ./observations/ --format sarif > findings.sarif
```

## Upload to GitHub code scanning[​](#upload-to-github-code-scanning "Direct link to Upload to GitHub code scanning")

### GitHub Actions[​](#github-actions "Direct link to GitHub Actions")

```
name: Stave Security Scan
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'terraform/**'
      - 'observations/**'

jobs:
  stave:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      security-events: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install Stave
        run: go install github.com/sufield/stave/cmd/stave@latest

      - name: Run evaluation
        run: stave apply --observations ./observations/ --format sarif > findings.sarif

      - name: Upload SARIF
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
        with:
          sarif_file: findings.sarif
          category: stave
```

### Key points[​](#key-points "Direct link to Key points")

* The `security-events: write` permission is required for upload
* The `category` field groups Stave findings separately from CodeQL
* SARIF upload works on push events and pull requests
* Findings appear in the repository's Security > Code scanning tab
* PR annotations show inline findings on changed files

## What SARIF includes[​](#what-sarif-includes "Direct link to What SARIF includes")

Each finding maps to a SARIF `result` with:

* `ruleId` — the control ID (e.g., `CTL.S3.BUCKET.VERSIONING.001`)
* `level` — mapped from Stave severity (`critical`/`high` → `error`, `medium` → `warning`, `low`/`info` → `note`)
* `message` — the finding evidence line
* `locations` — the resource ARN as a logical location

## Severity mapping[​](#severity-mapping "Direct link to Severity mapping")

| Stave severity | SARIF level | Code Scanning display |
| -------------- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| critical       | error       | Error (red)           |
| high           | error       | Error (red)           |
| medium         | warning     | Warning (yellow)      |
| low            | note        | Note (blue)           |
| info           | note        | Note (blue)           |

## Filtering[​](#filtering "Direct link to Filtering")

Combine with severity thresholds to control which findings reach code scanning:

```
stave apply --observations ./observations/ \
  --format sarif \
  --severity high > findings.sarif
```

Only `high` and `critical` findings appear in SARIF output.

## Scheduled scans[​](#scheduled-scans "Direct link to Scheduled scans")

The example workflow runs weekly (Monday 6 AM UTC). For continuous monitoring, change the cron schedule or add a `push` trigger.

## Exit codes and gating[​](#exit-codes-and-gating "Direct link to Exit codes and gating")

`stave apply` exits 3 when violations are found. In the workflow, this fails the job — the security gate blocks. The SARIF upload step uses `if: always()` so findings are uploaded even when the gate fails.

Exit 3 is not an error. It means Stave found real misconfigurations. The gate is working as designed.
