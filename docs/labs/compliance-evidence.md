# Generate Compliance Evidence

Your auditor wants evidence. Stave produces it deterministically — the same snapshot always yields the same verdicts, so the artifact is a verifiable record, not a point-in-time screenshot.

> **Environment:** `stave-mcp --render-scorecard` and `stave apply --format json` are on `$PATH` in the Coder workspace and after README Option 3 install. The `./obs/` path is wherever your collector saves snapshots; `~/examples/demo-s3-public-read/obs` in the workspace is a quick sanity-check target.

## Step 1: Render a compliance scorecard[​](#step-1-render-a-compliance-scorecard "Direct link to Step 1: Render a compliance scorecard")

```
stave-mcp --render-scorecard \
  --observations ./obs/ \
  --frameworks hipaa,pci_dss_v4.0,soc2
```

This prints a `file://` path to a self-contained HTML scorecard. It evaluates all requested frameworks in a single pass and shows:

* a tab per framework with its overall compliance percentage,
* each requirement as PASS / FAIL / N-A,
* click a failing requirement to expand the specific controls that failed, on which assets,
* a cross-framework comparison bar (lowest first = highest priority).

> See available framework IDs with `stave-mcp` is not needed — the common ones are `hipaa`, `pci_dss_v4.0`, `cis_aws_v3.0`, `fedramp_moderate`, `soc2`. Omit `--frameworks` to score them all.
>
> **What the percentage means:** it's *requirement coverage* — the fraction of a framework's requirements whose mapped controls pass. A snapshot can be `NON_COMPLIANT` overall yet show 100% on a framework whose mapped controls all pass; unmapped failures don't lower that framework's number.

## Step 2: Export the machine-readable evidence[​](#step-2-export-the-machine-readable-evidence "Direct link to Step 2: Export the machine-readable evidence")

The scorecard is for humans; the JSON is for the record:

```
mkdir -p evidence
stave apply --observations ./obs/ --format json \
  --eval-time "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
  > evidence/$(date +%Y%m%d).json
```

Pin `--eval-time` so the output is byte-stable. This JSON is deterministic evidence: same input, same output, every time. Hand it to the auditor alongside the scorecard. For a sealed, signed evidence package for air-gapped GRC, see `stave bundle` and `stave attest`.

## Step 3: Show improvement over time[​](#step-3-show-improvement-over-time "Direct link to Step 3: Show improvement over time")

Two dated evaluations *are* the compliance narrative:

```
ls evidence/
#   20260115.json   ← last quarter
#   20260420.json   ← now
```

The delta in framework coverage is the story you tell:

> "We were at 68% HIPAA requirement coverage last quarter. We're at 84% now, and here are the deterministic evaluations that prove it."

Because the verdicts are reproducible, anyone can re-run the same snapshot and get the same number — the evidence defends itself.
