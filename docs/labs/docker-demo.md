# Stave Tutorial Demo

44 S3 security scenarios in Docker. No AWS credentials required.

Stave ships with 2,891 controls across 85 domains and 10 compliance profiles. This Docker demo covers the S3 domain through 44 curated scenarios that progress from beginner to advanced.

## Install[​](#install "Direct link to Install")

```
git clone https://github.com/sufield/stave.git
cd stave
docker compose build
```

## Detect a misconfiguration[​](#detect-a-misconfiguration "Direct link to Detect a misconfiguration")

```
docker compose run --rm -T stave --scenario 1
```

The output shows:

1. The observation — a bucket with `public_read: true`
2. The stave command
3. The violation — CTL.S3.PUBLIC.001 detected public read access

## See the fix[​](#see-the-fix "Direct link to See the fix")

```
docker compose run --rm -T stave --scenario 1 --fixed
```

The output shows:

1. The observation — the same bucket with `public_read: false`
2. The same stave command
3. No violations — exit code 0

## See all 44 scenarios[​](#see-all-44-scenarios "Direct link to See all 44 scenarios")

```
docker compose run --rm -T stave --list
```

Pick any number from 1 to 44.

## HIPAA compliance profile[​](#hipaa-compliance-profile "Direct link to HIPAA compliance profile")

```
docker compose run --rm -T stave --hipaa
```

A PHI bucket with no Block Public Access, AWS-managed KMS key, no logging, no versioning, and a wildcard policy. Stave reports CRITICAL findings with HIPAA Security Rule citations and compound risks.

```
docker compose run --rm -T stave --hipaa --fixed
```

The same bucket with Block Public Access on, customer-managed CMK, server and object-level logging, versioning, COMPLIANCE Object Lock, VPC-only access, and ACLs disabled. All HIPAA-mapped S3 controls pass.

## Compound risk detection[​](#compound-risk-detection "Direct link to Compound risk detection")

```
docker compose run --rm -T stave --compound-risks
```

Detects dangerous combinations that individual checks miss. The pattern that caused the $190M Capital One breach — public access + wildcard IAM policy — is COMPOUND.001. Each finding is medium individually. Together they're critical. No checklist tool can detect this because they evaluate settings in isolation.

## Trusted Advisor blind spots[​](#trusted-advisor-blind-spots "Direct link to Trusted Advisor blind spots")

```
docker compose run --rm -T stave --blind-spots
```

Three S3 risks that AWS Trusted Advisor cannot detect.

## Try with your own bucket[​](#try-with-your-own-bucket "Direct link to Try with your own bucket")

```
docker compose run --rm -T stave --try-your-own
```

Prints step-by-step instructions to capture a real S3 bucket with the AWS CLI and evaluate it.

## Rebuild from scratch[​](#rebuild-from-scratch "Direct link to Rebuild from scratch")

```
docker compose down --rmi all
docker compose build
```

## Beyond S3: the full catalog[​](#beyond-s3-the-full-catalog "Direct link to Beyond S3: the full catalog")

This demo covers S3. Stave evaluates 2,891 controls across 85 domains:

```
# Compliance profiles — same engine, different framework lens
stave apply --profile hipaa --input observations.json --include-all
stave apply --profile cis-aws-v3.0 --input observations.json --include-all
stave apply --profile soc2 --input observations.json --include-all
stave apply --profile pci-dss-v4.0 --input observations.json --include-all
# Also: nist-800-53, fedramp, gdpr, ffiec, iso-27001, nist-csf-2.0
```

Domains: S3, IAM, VPC, EC2, RDS, ELB, K8s, CloudTrail, CloudWatch, KMS, Config, Secrets Manager, DynamoDB, SQS, SNS, Backup, API Gateway, ElastiCache, Cognito, GuardDuty, Security Hub, CloudFormation, Auto Scaling, Route 53, GCS, DNS.

## How stave works[​](#how-stave-works "Direct link to How stave works")

<!-- -->

## What you now know[​](#what-you-now-know "Direct link to What you now know")

By working through these scenarios you have:

* **Seen what an observation looks like** — a JSON snapshot of infrastructure configuration captured at a point in time (`obs.v0.1`)
* **Run `stave apply`** — the evaluation engine that checks observations against safety controls and reports violations
* **Read a finding** — control ID, severity, affected asset, evidence of the misconfiguration, and concrete remediation steps
* **Verified a fix** — the same command on a remediated observation produces zero violations (exit code 0)
* **Understood exit codes** — 0 means safe, 3 means violations found
* **Seen compound risks** — how dangerous combinations of individually medium findings create critical attack paths
* **Used your own data** — captured a real S3 bucket with the AWS CLI and evaluated it with stave
* **The same engine works across all 85 domains and 10 compliance frameworks** — this demo is the S3 subset
