# Unauthenticated Reachability

Unauthenticated reachability answers: "Can an anonymous principal reach this sensitive resource through any composition of access grants?"

This is a system-level composition check. Individual resources may pass every check in isolation, but the composition of API Gateway → Lambda → IAM Role → S3 Bucket creates an unauthenticated path to data. Stave detects this by evaluating pre-computed reachability metadata from the extractor.

## How it works[​](#how-it-works "Direct link to How it works")

### Extractor computes, Stave evaluates[​](#extractor-computes-stave-evaluates "Direct link to Extractor computes, Stave evaluates")

The extractor performs BFS from the anonymous principal node and stores the results as observation properties. Stave evaluates them:

```
Extractor                              Stave
────────                              ─────
Build directed graph from config →    Check reachable == true
BFS from anonymous principal    →    Check target_data_classification in [phi, pii, confidential]
Count hops in shortest path     →    Check path_hop_count > 3
Detect auth boundaries          →    Check has_auth_boundary == false
Detect inspection boundaries    →    Check has_inspection_boundary == false
Track graph completeness        →    Check is_fully_resolved == false
Record blocking points          →    Display proof of obstruction
Store on each target resource   →    Evaluate as standard predicates
```

This preserves Stave's core promise: deterministic evaluation of YAML controls against observation properties.

### Graph model[​](#graph-model "Direct link to Graph model")

The extractor builds a directed graph where:

**Nodes:** Principals (IAM users, roles, service principals, anonymous) and resources (S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables, Lambda functions, API Gateways).

**Edges:** Access grants — IAM policies, bucket policies, role assumptions (`sts:AssumeRole`), VPC endpoint policies, Lambda resource-based policies, security group rules.

**Traversal:** BFS from the anonymous node. Every resource reached is annotated with path metadata.

### Observation properties[​](#observation-properties "Direct link to Observation properties")

The extractor populates these fields on each reachable target resource:

```
properties:
  reachability:
    kind: anonymous_path
    anonymous_path:
      reachable: true
      path_hop_count: 4
      path_summary:
        - node_type: entry_point
          id: "apigateway:my-api/GET/*"
          fix_hint: "aws apigateway update-method --authorization-type COGNITO_USER_POOLS"
        - node_type: compute
          id: "lambda:my-function"
        - node_type: identity
          id: "iam_role:my-lambda-role"
        - node_type: storage
          id: "s3:my-phi-bucket"
          fix_hint: "Restrict s3:GetObject to VPC endpoint"
      target_data_classification: phi
      has_auth_boundary: false
      auth_boundary_types: []
      has_inspection_boundary: true
      inspection_boundary_types: ["waf"]
      is_fully_resolved: true
      entry_point_type: apigateway
      blocked_at: null
```

**Boundary types** — authentication and inspection are distinct:

| Category       | Verifies                          | Types                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Authentication | Identity (who are you?)           | `cognito`, `lambda_authorizer`, `iam`, `mtls` |
| Inspection     | Request safety (is it malicious?) | `waf`, `api_gateway_request_validation`       |

A path with WAF but no authorizer is inspected but still unauthenticated. Both are needed for defense-in-depth.

**Graph completeness** — when the extractor cannot resolve all nodes:

* `is_fully_resolved: false` — safety cannot be proven
* `unresolved_reason: "access_denied_on_iam_policy_lookup"` — why

**Negative assurance** — when `reachable == false`, the `blocked_at` field records where the path was terminated, providing formal proof of safety:

```
blocked_at:
  node_type: entry_point
  id: "apigateway:my-api/GET/*"
  reason: cognito_authorizer
```

### Extractor analysis steps[​](#extractor-analysis-steps "Direct link to Extractor analysis steps")

1. Enumerate all API Gateway stages, ALB listeners, and other public entry points
2. For each entry point, follow Lambda integrations and backend targets
3. For each Lambda function, resolve its execution role
4. For each IAM role, parse attached and inline policies for resource access grants
5. For each accessible resource, read its data classification tags
6. Detect **authentication** boundaries (Cognito, Lambda authorizer, IAM, mTLS) — these verify identity
7. Detect **inspection** boundaries (WAF, API Gateway request validation) — these filter malicious requests
8. Track **graph completeness** — if any node cannot be resolved (access denied, missing config), mark `is_fully_resolved: false`
9. For unreachable resources, record **where** the path was blocked in `blocked_at` (proof of obstruction)
10. Encode each path node as an object with `node_type`, `id`, and `fix_hint` — prefer ingress fixes over egress for efficiency
11. Store results as `reachability.*` properties on the target asset

## Controls[​](#controls "Direct link to Controls")

### CTL.EXPOSURE.ANON.001 — Sensitive resource reachable from anonymous[​](#ctlexposureanon001--sensitive-resource-reachable-from-anonymous "Direct link to CTL.EXPOSURE.ANON.001 — Sensitive resource reachable from anonymous")

```
Fires when: reachable == true
        AND target_data_classification in [phi, pii, confidential]
Severity: critical
```

A resource tagged with sensitive data is reachable from the public internet through a composition of access grants. This is the core Prompt 11 finding — the composition attack that individual resource checks cannot detect.

**Remediation:** Add an authorization layer to the path. Configure an API Gateway authorizer (Cognito, Lambda, or IAM), attach a WAF with managed rule groups, or revoke the intermediate role's access to the sensitive resource.

### CTL.EXPOSURE.ANON.002 — Deep unauthenticated chain[​](#ctlexposureanon002--deep-unauthenticated-chain "Direct link to CTL.EXPOSURE.ANON.002 — Deep unauthenticated chain")

```
Fires when: reachable == true
        AND path_hop_count > 3
Severity: high
```

Deep access chains (4+ hops) indicate unintended transitive access. Each hop is an access grant that widens the blast radius beyond what was intended. Shorter paths are more likely intentional.

**Remediation:** Flatten the chain. Remove unnecessary intermediate services. Scope Lambda execution role permissions to minimum required resources. Replace broad role assumption chains with direct service-linked roles.

### CTL.EXPOSURE.ANON.003 — No auth boundary in path[​](#ctlexposureanon003--no-auth-boundary-in-path "Direct link to CTL.EXPOSURE.ANON.003 — No auth boundary in path")

```
Fires when: reachable == true
        AND has_auth_boundary == false
Severity: high
```

The path from anonymous to the resource has no authentication boundary — no identity verification point (Cognito, Lambda authorizer, IAM, mTLS). An inspection boundary (WAF) may exist but does not establish identity. The path is still unauthenticated.

**Remediation:** Add an authentication boundary. Configure a Cognito user pool or Lambda authorizer on API Gateway routes. Enable IAM authorization. For service-to-service, enable mTLS.

### CTL.EXPOSURE.ANON.004 — No inspection boundary in path[​](#ctlexposureanon004--no-inspection-boundary-in-path "Direct link to CTL.EXPOSURE.ANON.004 — No inspection boundary in path")

```
Fires when: reachable == true
        AND has_inspection_boundary == false
Severity: medium
```

The path has no request filtering — no WAF managed rules, no API Gateway request validation. Even if authenticated, malicious payloads are not inspected. Both boundaries needed for defense-in-depth.

**Remediation:** Attach a WAF web ACL with managed rule groups to the API Gateway stage or ALB. Enable API Gateway request validation.

### CTL.EXPOSURE.ANON.PARTIAL.001 — Partially resolved path[​](#ctlexposureanonpartial001--partially-resolved-path "Direct link to CTL.EXPOSURE.ANON.PARTIAL.001 — Partially resolved path")

```
Fires when: reachable == true
        AND is_fully_resolved == false
Severity: medium
```

The extractor found a path from anonymous but could not resolve all intermediate nodes. Safety cannot be proven for the unresolved segment. This is the "unknown" state — the extractor needs additional permissions.

**Remediation:** Grant the extractor read access to unresolved resources (iam:GetRolePolicy, lambda:GetFunction, etc.).

## Safety chain: unauthenticated\_data\_path[​](#safety-chain-unauthenticated_data_path "Direct link to Safety chain: unauthenticated_data_path")

The reachability controls participate in a compound chain together with entry point protection controls:

```
id: unauthenticated_data_path
controls:
  - CTL.EXPOSURE.ANON.001  # sensitive data reachable
  - CTL.EXPOSURE.ANON.003  # no auth boundary
  - CTL.APIGATEWAY.AUTH.001 # API Gateway without authorization
  - CTL.WAF.RULES.001       # WAF without managed rules
escalation_threshold: 2
compound_severity: critical
```

When a sensitive resource is reachable AND there is no auth boundary, the compound finding fires: "anonymous principal can reach sensitive data through a composition of access grants with zero friction."

Compound Risk Chains
--------------------

  [CRITICAL] Chain: unauthenticated_data_path
  Sensitive resource reachable from anonymous with no auth boundary.
  Failing:    CTL.EXPOSURE.ANON.001, CTL.EXPOSURE.ANON.003
  Fix any of: CTL.APIGATEWAY.AUTH.001, CTL.WAF.RULES.001

```

"Fix any of" shows the cheapest remediation: adding an API Gateway authorizer or enabling WAF rules would break the chain below its escalation threshold.

### Safe path (proof of obstruction)[​](#safe-path-proof-of-obstruction "Direct link to Safe path (proof of obstruction)")

When `reachable == false`, the `blocked_at` field proves where the path was terminated:

```
{
  "reachability": {
    "kind": "anonymous_path",
    "anonymous_path": {
      "reachable": false,
      "blocked_at": {
        "node_type": "entry_point",
        "id": "apigateway:my-api/GET/*",
        "reason": "cognito_authorizer"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Reading: "Anonymous node explored. Path blocked at API Gateway 'my-api' by mandatory Cognito authorization." This is the formal proof of safety that auditors need: "here is where and why the path was stopped."

### Partially resolved path[​](#partially-resolved-path "Direct link to Partially resolved path")

When the extractor cannot see the full graph:

```
{
  "reachability": {
    "kind": "anonymous_path",
    "anonymous_path": {
      "reachable": true,
      "is_fully_resolved": false,
      "unresolved_reason": "access_denied_on_iam_policy_lookup"
    }
  }
}
```

Reading: "We found a path from anonymous to Lambda, but cannot prove safety beyond that point due to missing metadata." The CTL.EXPOSURE.ANON.PARTIAL.001 control fires at medium severity.

### Fix efficiency in path\_summary[​](#fix-efficiency-in-path_summary "Direct link to Fix efficiency in path_summary")

Each node carries a `fix_hint` with the recommended remediation. Fixes at the ingress (entry point) are more efficient than fixes at the egress (target resource):

```
{
  "path_summary": [
    {"node_type": "entry_point", "id": "apigateway:my-api/GET/*",
     "fix_hint": "Enable Cognito authorizer (blocks ALL paths through this API)"},
    {"node_type": "compute", "id": "lambda:my-function", "fix_hint": null},
    {"node_type": "identity", "id": "iam_role:my-lambda-role", "fix_hint": null},
    {"node_type": "storage", "id": "s3:my-phi-bucket",
     "fix_hint": "Restrict s3:GetObject to VPC endpoint (protects this bucket only)"}
  ]
}
```

The entry point fix protects every resource behind that API. The target fix protects only one bucket. Both are valid — the entry point is higher efficiency, the target is defense-in-depth.

## The composition problem[​](#the-composition-problem "Direct link to The composition problem")

Individual resource checks evaluate each component in isolation. Composition checks evaluate the access path end-to-end:

| Approach     | What it evaluates                                         | Result                                               |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Per-resource | API Gateway: PASS, Lambda: PASS, IAM Role: PASS, S3: PASS | 4 individual passes                                  |
| Composition  | anonymous → API GW → Lambda → Role → S3 (PHI)             | **CRITICAL: unauthenticated path to sensitive data** |

Each resource is correctly configured for its intended purpose. The API Gateway is meant to be public. The Lambda function needs its execution role. The role needs S3 access. The composition reveals the emergent risk — the end-to-end path that individual checks cannot see.
