# Threat Model

This document describes the assets Stave protects, the threats it faces, and how each is mitigated.

## Assets[​](#assets "Direct link to Assets")

| Asset                 | Sensitivity                                                        | Where                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Observation snapshots | May contain infrastructure details, bucket names, ARNs, tags       | User filesystem (input)            |
| Evaluation findings   | Reveals which assets are unsafe and why                            | stdout or `--out` file             |
| Stave binary          | Must be authentic and untampered                                   | User filesystem / release download |
| Control definitions   | Define what "unsafe" means; tampering changes evaluation semantics | User filesystem or shipped pack    |

## Trust Boundaries[​](#trust-boundaries "Direct link to Trust Boundaries")

### 1. File Input Boundary[​](#1-file-input-boundary "Direct link to 1. File Input Boundary")

Stave reads observation and control files from the local filesystem. Observations are treated as **untrusted input** — they may come from external tools and could be malformed or crafted.

**Controls:**

* Full JSON Schema validation with `additionalProperties: false` — extra fields cause immediate rejection.
* Path traversal protection on control registry paths.
* Bucket name validation against S3 naming rules before use in file paths.
* All user-supplied paths cleaned with `filepath.Clean`.

### 2. File Output Boundary[​](#2-file-output-boundary "Direct link to 2. File Output Boundary")

Stave writes findings to stdout or to files specified by `--out`.

**Controls:**

* No-overwrite by default — refuses to write over existing files without `--force`.
* No-symlink-write by default — refuses to write through symbolic links without `--allow-symlink-output`.
* Restricted permissions: directories `0700`, files `0600`.
* No implicit temp files, caches, or config directories.

### 3. Build and Release Boundary[​](#3-build-and-release-boundary "Direct link to 3. Build and Release Boundary")

The release pipeline builds, signs, and publishes artifacts.

**Controls:**

* SHA-256 checksums for integrity.
* Sigstore Cosign keyless signing via GitHub Actions OIDC.
* SPDX SBOM for dependency transparency.
* GitHub-native SLSA build provenance attestation.
* License compliance (`go-licenses check`) — GPL/AGPL/SSPL/LGPL fail the build.
* Dependabot for dependency monitoring.
* govulncheck on every PR.

## Attacker Profiles[​](#attacker-profiles "Direct link to Attacker Profiles")

### A1: Malicious Input[​](#a1-malicious-input "Direct link to A1: Malicious Input")

**Goal:** Exploit Stave through crafted observation or control files.

| Attack Vector                       | Control                                                            |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Schema injection (extra fields)     | `additionalProperties: false` rejects unknown fields               |
| Path traversal vian asset IDs       | Bucket name validation; `filepath.Clean` on all paths              |
| Path traversal via control registry | Registry validates relative paths stay within root                 |
| Oversized input (DoS)               | Go's JSON/YAML parsers have bounded memory; no unbounded buffering |
| Malformed timestamps                | RFC 3339 parsing rejects invalid dates                             |

### A2: Supply-Chain Attack[​](#a2-supply-chain-attack "Direct link to A2: Supply-Chain Attack")

**Goal:** Replace the Stave binary or its dependencies with a malicious version.

| Attack Vector                 | Control                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Artifact tampering in transit | SHA-256 checksums detect modification                    |
| Malicious release replacement | Cosign signature binds artifacts to CI workflow identity |
| Compromised build host        | GitHub provenance attestation proves CI origin           |
| Hidden dependencies           | SBOM provides full dependency audit trail                |
| Vulnerable dependencies       | govulncheck on every PR; Dependabot monitoring           |
| Unauthorized release          | Sigstore OIDC ties signing to GitHub Actions context     |

### A3: Local Attacker[​](#a3-local-attacker "Direct link to A3: Local Attacker")

**Goal:** Read evaluation results or tamper with output on a shared system.

| Attack Vector                 | Control                               |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Read output files             | `0600` file permissions (owner-only)  |
| Read output directories       | `0700` directory permissions          |
| Symlink attack on output path | Symlink write protection (default on) |
| Overwrite existing files      | No-overwrite protection (default on)  |

### A4: Credential Harvesting[​](#a4-credential-harvesting "Direct link to A4: Credential Harvesting")

**Goal:** Use Stave as a vector to exfiltrate credentials.

| Attack Vector            | Control                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Read credential env vars | Stave reads no credential env vars (only `NO_COLOR`)                |
| Read credential files    | Stave reads no credential files                                     |
| Network exfiltration     | No `net/http`, `net/rpc`, `crypto/tls` — architecturally impossible |
| Subprocess exfiltration  | No `os/exec` — architecturally impossible                           |

## Residual Risks[​](#residual-risks "Direct link to Residual Risks")

These risks are acknowledged but not fully mitigated by Stave:

| Risk                            | Impact                                          | Remediation Guidance                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Snapshot sensitivity**        | Terraform exports may contain embedded secrets  | Use `--sanitize` when sharing output. Do not include raw secrets in state files passed to Stave.                                         |
| **Umask on shared systems**     | Weak umask may expose output files              | Set `umask 077` before running Stave. Write to a private directory.                                                                      |
| **Provenance requires network** | `gh attestation verify` needs GitHub API access | Checksum + Cosign verification are sufficient for offline environments. Provenance adds defense-in-depth when connectivity is available. |
| **Control tampering**           | Modified controls change evaluation semantics   | Ship controls from a trusted source. Validate with `stave validate` before evaluation. Use version control.                              |
| **Log verbosity**               | `-vv` may include file paths in logs            | Use `--path-mode=base` (default) to show basenames only. Defensive log sanitization strips known sensitive patterns.                     |

## Security Tests[​](#security-tests "Direct link to Security Tests")

The following CI tests enforce the threat model:

| Test                           | What It Enforces                         |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `TestNoBannedImportsInRuntime` | 8 banned packages not in runtime binary  |
| `TestNoHTTPSchemaIdentifiers`  | Schema IDs use `urn:` not `http:`        |
| `TestNoCredentialEnvVars`      | No credential environment variable reads |
| `TestOfflineHelpSuffix`        | Help text documents offline operation    |
