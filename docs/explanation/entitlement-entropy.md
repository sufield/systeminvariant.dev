# Entitlement Entropy — Shadow Admin Finder

Entitlement entropy detects privilege creep — the structural condition where an IAM role has accumulated permissions beyond its original scope, creating hidden lateral movement paths that do not appear dangerous when viewed through any single permission in isolation.

## The problem[​](#the-problem "Direct link to The problem")

A role starts as `S3-ReadOnly`. Over two years, someone adds `kms:Decrypt`, then `lambda:InvokeFunction`, then `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue`, then `iam:GetRole`. The role is still named `S3-ReadOnly`. It has no admin policy. No scanner that evaluates permissions in isolation will flag it. But it can now read encrypted PHI, trigger arbitrary Lambda functions, retrieve any secret, and enumerate the IAM inventory. This is a Shadow Admin by accumulation.

## Three deterministic signals[​](#three-deterministic-signals "Direct link to Three deterministic signals")

### Signal 1: Unused permission accumulation[​](#signal-1-unused-permission-accumulation "Direct link to Signal 1: Unused permission accumulation")

Source: AWS Access Advisor last-accessed data. A role with 30 accessible services where 25 are never used has accumulated permissions far beyond its operational scope.

**Control:** CTL.IAM.ROLE.PERMISSIONDRIFT.001 — fires when >20% of services are unused for >90 days. Threshold overridable via `stave/permission-drift-threshold` tag on the role.

### Signal 2: Permission category mixing[​](#signal-2-permission-category-mixing "Direct link to Signal 2: Permission category mixing")

Source: permission action categorization against a defined taxonomy. Structurally incompatible pairs: data\_read + iam\_write (access data AND modify who else can), compute\_control + iam\_write (create compute AND grant it permissions), audit\_control + data\_read (access data AND cover tracks).

**Control:** CTL.IAM.ROLE.CATEGORYMIX.001 — fires when a role spans any incompatible category pair.

### Signal 3: Tag-declared intent vs. actual permissions[​](#signal-3-tag-declared-intent-vs-actual-permissions "Direct link to Signal 3: Tag-declared intent vs. actual permissions")

Source: `role-type` tag value compared against a compatibility matrix. A role tagged `readonly` with `iam_write` permissions is a governance failure.

**Controls:** CTL.IAM.ROLE.INTENTTAG.001 (tag must exist), CTL.IAM.ROLE.INTENTMISMATCH.001 (permissions must match tag).

## Safety chains[​](#safety-chains "Direct link to Safety chains")

Two compound chains escalate when multiple signals fire simultaneously:

**shadow\_admin\_by\_accumulation** — permission drift + category mixing

* intent mismatch. Three signals confirm the role is a Shadow Admin.

**privilege\_creep\_lateral\_movement** — category mixing + permission drift. Data access combined with IAM write, plus high unused ratio.

## Business value[​](#business-value "Direct link to Business value")

1. **Continuous access review** — SOC2 CC6.3, PCI-DSS 7.2, HIPAA 164.312(a)(2)(i) all require periodic access reviews. These controls make privilege creep continuously detectable, not just at audit time.
2. **Blast radius reduction** — the unused permissions on a compromised role ARE the blast radius. Removing them shrinks the attack surface.
3. **Governance forcing function** — the `role-type` tag requirement converts access reviews from "read the name and guess" to "compare declared purpose against actual permissions."
4. **Evidence for remediation conversations** — Access Advisor data makes unused permissions an operational fact, not a security assertion.
