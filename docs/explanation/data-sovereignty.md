# Data Sovereignty

Data sovereignty analysis answers: "Is your data physically in the right jurisdiction AND logically inaccessible from outside it?"

Checking that a bucket is in `eu-west-1` is half the story. The other half: can a principal in `us-east-1` read it? Data residency is physically correct but logically violated when cross-jurisdiction access exists.

## The sovereignty model[​](#the-sovereignty-model "Direct link to The sovereignty model")

```
Resource (eu-west-1, PII) ← s3:GetObject ← Principal (us-east-1)
```

The data is in the EU. The access power is in the US. GDPR Article 44 prohibits this transfer. The extractor maps resource jurisdictions to accessor jurisdictions and flags edges that cross sovereignty boundaries.

## How it works[​](#how-it-works "Direct link to How it works")

```
properties:
  reachability:
    kind: cross_border
    sovereignty:
      cross_border_access_detected: true
      resource_jurisdiction: eu
      accessor_jurisdiction: us
      target_sensitivity: pii
```

Jurisdiction codes are generalized to support GDPR (EU), CCPA (US-CA), FedRAMP (US-GOV), and custom boundaries.

### CTL.EXPOSURE.SOVEREIGNTY.001 — Cross-border access to sensitive data[​](#ctlexposuresovereignty001--cross-border-access-to-sensitive-data "Direct link to CTL.EXPOSURE.SOVEREIGNTY.001 — Cross-border access to sensitive data")

```
Fires when: cross_border_access_detected == true
        AND target_sensitivity in [phi, pii, confidential]
Severity: high
```

A sensitive resource in one jurisdiction is accessible from a principal in a different jurisdiction.

**Remediation:** Use IAM condition keys to restrict access by source VPC or IP range within the jurisdiction. Apply SCPs to deny cross-jurisdiction access at the organization level.

## Safety chain: sovereignty\_violation[​](#safety-chain-sovereignty_violation "Direct link to Safety chain: sovereignty_violation")

```
id: sovereignty_violation
controls:
  - CTL.EXPOSURE.SOVEREIGNTY.001
  - CTL.S3.REGION.001
escalation_threshold: 2
compound_severity: high
```

Data residency control exists (S3 region approved) but is structurally violated by cross-border access paths.
