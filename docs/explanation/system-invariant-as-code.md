# System Invariant as Code

## Definition[​](#definition "Direct link to Definition")

System Invariant as Code means you define a small set of safety truths that must always hold for your system, then evaluate snapshots against those truths.

In Stave, a control is a YAML rule (for example: "PHI buckets are never public"). A finding is produced only when observed system state violates that rule.

## The Problem[​](#the-problem "Direct link to The Problem")

Many teams have policy checks, scanners, and cloud dashboards, but still struggle to answer:

* Did this unsafe condition persist long enough to matter?
* Can we prove the same result from the same snapshot every time?
* Can we run this in air-gapped review environments with no cloud credentials?

Stave focuses on deterministic, offline proofs over local snapshots.

## Formal Model[​](#formal-model "Direct link to Formal Model")

Let:

* `S_t` be an observation snapshot at time `t`
* `I` be a control predicate over asset properties
* `U(r, t) = 1` when asset `r` is unsafe in snapshot `S_t` under `I`

For `unsafe_state`, a violation exists if `U(r, t_now) = 1`.

For `unsafe_duration`, a violation exists when:

* `U(r, t_now) = 1`
* and `(t_now - t_first_unsafe(r)) > threshold`

This is why Stave can express "unsafe now" and "unsafe for too long" as separate control types.

## Example: S3 PHI bucket must not be public[​](#example-s3-phi-bucket-must-not-be-public "Direct link to Example: S3 PHI bucket must not be public")

A simplified control:

```
dsl_version: ctrl.v1
id: CTL.S3.PUBLIC.001
name: No Public S3 Buckets
description: S3 buckets with sensitive data must not be publicly readable or listable.
domain: exposure
scope_tags: [aws, s3]
type: unsafe_state
unsafe_predicate:
  any:
    - field: properties.storage.access.public_read
      op: eq
      value: true
    - field: properties.storage.access.public_list
      op: eq
      value: true
```

If either property is true in a snapshot, Stave emits a finding.

## When to use together[​](#when-to-use-together "Direct link to When to use together")

* Stave + OPA: Use OPA for request-time or pipeline gate policy decisions; use Stave to prove state controls over snapshots and time-based thresholds.
* Stave + CSPM: Use CSPM for continuous cloud detection; use Stave for offline, deterministic replay and preflight checks with no API access.

## How it differs from OPA / tfsec / CSPM[​](#how-it-differs-from-opa--tfsec--cspm "Direct link to How it differs from OPA / tfsec / CSPM")

* **OPA/Sentinel:** general policy engines for decisions. **Stave:** control evaluation over snapshot history with compound risk scoring.
* **tfsec/Checkov:** static IaC analysis. **Stave:** evaluation of normalized observed state snapshots with duration tracking.
* **CSPM:** live cloud visibility with API calls. **Stave:** offline evaluation with local files, deterministic rankings.

## Scope boundaries[​](#scope-boundaries "Direct link to Scope boundaries")

* **Evaluation-first** — Stave evaluates observations and ships a built-in converter (`stave transform`, jq filters) that reshapes raw snapshots into `obs.v0.1`; collection and remediation are separate programs.
* **Offline by design** — all inputs are local files; cloud API access belongs to collectors, not Stave.
* **Deterministic** — same inputs always produce the same findings, scores, and rankings.

## Developer Workflow[​](#developer-workflow "Direct link to Developer Workflow")

This workflow is for contributors and product engineers using Stave without changing Stave internals.

1. Prepare observations as `obs.v0.1` JSON snapshots in a local directory.
2. Prepare controls as `ctrl.v1` YAML files (for example under `controls/s3`).
3. Validate artifacts before evaluation:
   * `stave validate --controls <dir> --observations <dir>`
4. Run evaluation:
   * `stave apply --controls <dir> --observations <dir> --max-unsafe <duration>`
5. If results are unexpected, run diagnostics:
   * `stave diagnose --controls <dir> --observations <dir> [--previous-output <file>]`
6. Iterate on control definitions and input quality (not on Stave code) until outputs match expected safety intent.

## Responsibility Split[​](#responsibility-split "Direct link to Responsibility Split")

### Developers must do[​](#developers-must-do "Direct link to Developers must do")

* Define control intent in YAML (IDs, predicate logic, thresholds).
* Produce valid observation snapshots from approved sources.
* Choose runtime options (`--max-unsafe`, `--eval-time`).
* Review and act on violations/diagnostics.
* Version-control control definitions and snapshots as evidence artifacts.

### Stave provides out of the box[​](#stave-provides-out-of-the-box "Direct link to Stave provides out of the box")

* Schema validation for control and observation contracts.
* Deterministic evaluation logic over snapshots and time windows.
* Built-in operator semantics (`eq`, `in`, `missing`, `any_match`, etc.).
* Standardized output structures (JSON/text flows with safety envelope validation where enabled).
* Diagnostics for common mismatch causes (threshold too high, insufficient span, reset behavior, clock skew).
* Offline operation (no cloud credentials required at evaluation time).

## What does NOT require changing Stave code[​](#what-does-not-require-changing-stave-code "Direct link to What does NOT require changing Stave code")

For normal adoption, teams should only change:

* Control YAML files
* Observation snapshot inputs
* CLI runtime flags

Teams should not need to modify:

* `internal/core` evaluator logic
* app use-case orchestration
* input/output adapters

If you need those code changes, treat it as platform extension work, not normal control authoring.
