# Secret Blast Radius

Secret blast radius answers: "If this secret is compromised, how much sensitive data is exposed?"

Standard scanners check if a secret is rotated. Stave checks if that secret is a master key to sensitive data — and how many principals have access to it.

## The secret-to-data path[​](#the-secret-to-data-path "Direct link to The secret-to-data path")

```
Principal → secretsmanager:GetSecretValue → DB Credentials → RDS (PHI)
```

A secret in Secrets Manager is a direct path to the data it unlocks. The number of principals who can read the secret determines the blast radius — each reader is a potential credential compromise path that bypasses IAM least privilege on the data resource itself.

## How it works[​](#how-it-works "Direct link to How it works")

The extractor identifies secrets, maps them to target resources, and counts the principals with `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue`:

```
properties:
  secret:
    kind: secret
    blast_radius:
      target_resource_id: "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123:db/prod"
      target_sensitivity: phi
      privileged_reader_count: 7
      access_vector: cross_account
      is_rotated: false
```

## Controls[​](#controls "Direct link to Controls")

### CTL.SECRET.BLAST.001 — Multiple readers targeting sensitive resource[​](#ctlsecretblast001--multiple-readers-targeting-sensitive-resource "Direct link to CTL.SECRET.BLAST.001 — Multiple readers targeting sensitive resource")

```
Fires when: privileged_reader_count > 3
        AND target_sensitivity in [phi, pii, confidential]
Severity: critical
```

Too many principals can read a secret that unlocks sensitive data. Each reader is an independent credential compromise vector.

**Remediation:** Reduce readers to minimum required. Use resource-based policies on the secret. Enable automatic rotation.

### CTL.SECRET.BLAST.002 — Cross-account access to sensitive secret[​](#ctlsecretblast002--cross-account-access-to-sensitive-secret "Direct link to CTL.SECRET.BLAST.002 — Cross-account access to sensitive secret")

```
Fires when: access_vector == "cross_account"
        AND target_sensitivity in [phi, pii, confidential]
Severity: critical
```

A secret targeting sensitive data is readable from another AWS account, doubling the blast radius.

**Remediation:** Remove cross-account access. If required, restrict to specific role ARNs with external ID conditions.
