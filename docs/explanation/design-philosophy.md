# Design Philosophy

Stave is designed around open standards from the first release so teams can adopt it without platform lock-in.

## Core Principles[​](#core-principles "Direct link to Core Principles")

1. Contract-first: data is exchanged through versioned, documented schemas.
2. Vendor-neutral: extractors can be built in any language and for any platform.
3. Deterministic by default: same inputs + same `--eval-time` produce the same output.
4. Offline-capable: evaluation and validation work without cloud credentials.
5. Composable CLI: commands fit CI/CD pipelines through stable flags, outputs, and exit codes.

## Standardization Surface[​](#standardization-surface "Direct link to Standardization Surface")

* Controls: `ctrl.v1` YAML
* Observations: `obs.v0.1` JSON
* Evaluation/verification output: `out.v0.1` JSON
* JSON Schema contracts under `schemas/`

Because these are open files and versioned contracts, teams can:

* Generate observations from their own systems and tools
* Validate data independently in other runtimes
* Store, diff, and audit artifacts in any repository or data platform
* Change cloud vendors or scanners without rewriting Stave core logic

## What This Means in Practice[​](#what-this-means-in-practice "Direct link to What This Means in Practice")

* Stave runs as a standalone CLI — bring your own CI runner, laptop, or air-gapped host.
* Controls are YAML with a standard predicate DSL — portable across teams and toolchains.
* Artifacts remain portable across local development, CI runners, and audit workflows.

Stave is a standards-based safety layer designed for composability.
