# Temporal Ghost Detection

A **temporal ghost** is a configuration reference that was valid in a previous snapshot but is invalid in the current one — the referenced resource was deleted between observations. Unlike single-snapshot ghost detection (which compares references against the *current* inventory and is vulnerable to extractor-race false positives), temporal ghost detection compares against *historical* inventory to confirm a resource genuinely existed-then-disappeared.

## Why this shape exists[​](#why-this-shape-exists "Direct link to Why this shape exists")

Stave's broader ghost-reference family (23 controls covering IAM policies, resource policies, event triggers, compute dependencies, network infrastructure, cross-account trust, etc.) catches dangling references against a single snapshot's inventory. That single-snapshot mode has one structural weakness: if the collector races a deletion and a re-creation, the reference can look like a ghost when it isn't.

Temporal ghost detection eliminates the race. A reference is confirmed-ghost only when **two independent snapshots** witness the disappearance — the referenced resource was present in snapshot N-1, absent in snapshot N, and the reference persists. This is the **highest-confidence** ghost finding the catalog produces.

The two controls that ship with this shape:

| Control                             | Shape                                                                                                                                                                             | Severity |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `CTL.GHOST.TEMPORAL.RESOURCE.001`   | Resource present in snapshot N-1, absent in N, references persist in N                                                                                                            | high     |
| `CTL.GHOST.TEMPORAL.PERMISSION.001` | Policy Resource pattern broadened from specific ARN → wildcard between snapshots, coinciding with a resource deletion in the same window — a scope expansion disguised as cleanup | medium   |

## `CTL.GHOST.TEMPORAL.RESOURCE.001`[​](#ctlghosttemporalresource001 "Direct link to ctlghosttemporalresource001")

Predicate:

```
unsafe_predicate:
  all:
    - field: properties.governance.kind
      op: eq
      value: temporal_analysis
    - field: properties.governance.ghost.has_temporal_ghost
      op: eq
      value: true
```

The collector emits a synthetic `temporal_analysis` asset that encodes the cross-snapshot comparison. `has_temporal_ghost` flips to `true` only when both observations confirm the deletion — single absence does not fire the control.

Severity inheritance (from the control description):

| Reference type                             | Severity |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Write permissions to reclaimable resources | critical |
| Monitoring targets that disappeared        | critical |
| Read permissions                           | high     |
| Configuration references                   | medium   |

## `CTL.GHOST.TEMPORAL.PERMISSION.001`[​](#ctlghosttemporalpermission001 "Direct link to ctlghosttemporalpermission001")

Predicate:

```
unsafe_predicate:
  all:
    - field: properties.identity.kind
      op: eq
      value: role
    - field: properties.identity.policy.has_broadened_scope
      op: eq
      value: true
```

Detects a specific failure mode: someone tries to "fix" a ghost reference by widening the policy's `Resource` pattern (e.g., `arn:aws:s3:::specific-bucket/*` → `arn:aws:s3:::*`). The widening satisfies the ghost-reference detector but **expands the blast radius** of any future re-creation. The resource that was deleted was specific; the new wildcard pattern admits any future bucket the account creates, including one an attacker could provision under the same role's trust boundary.

Same pattern operators encounter in incident postmortems: *"We deleted the bucket but the policy still referenced it. We broadened the pattern to make the policy parse. Six months later we created a new bucket and the role had read access we didn't intend."*

## How the collector emits the temporal evidence[​](#how-the-collector-emits-the-temporal-evidence "Direct link to How the collector emits the temporal evidence")

Stave's two-snapshot semantics handle this generically — the collector compares snapshot N-1 against snapshot N during projection and emits a `governance.temporal_analysis` asset carrying the cross-snapshot booleans:

```
{
  "id": "temporal-analysis-2026-05-11",
  "type": "aws_temporal_analysis",
  "vendor": "aws",
  "properties": {
    "governance": {
      "kind": "temporal_analysis",
      "ghost": {
        "has_temporal_ghost": true,
        "deleted_arn": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:111122223333:function:archived-job",
        "snapshots": ["2026-05-04T00:00:00Z", "2026-05-11T00:00:00Z"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The control predicate reads only `has_temporal_ghost`; the auxiliary fields surface in the finding's evidence block so an auditor can see which ARN disappeared and across which window.

## Relationship to the broader ghost family[​](#relationship-to-the-broader-ghost-family "Direct link to Relationship to the broader ghost family")

| Detection mode                                   | Confidence                                          | Example controls                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Single-snapshot ghost (current-inventory check)  | Standard — vulnerable to extractor races            | `CTL.IAM.POLICY.GHOSTREF.001`, `CTL.CLOUDFRONT.GHOST.ORIGIN.001`, `CTL.COGNITO.GHOST.PRESIGNUP.001` (and 18 more) |
| **Temporal ghost (cross-snapshot confirmation)** | **Highest** — confirmed-deleted by two observations | `CTL.GHOST.TEMPORAL.RESOURCE.001`, `CTL.GHOST.TEMPORAL.PERMISSION.001`                                            |

The two modes are **complementary**, not competing:

* Single-snapshot ghost fires immediately when a reference looks dangling. Useful for real-time CI/CD gating; some false-positive rate during collector races is acceptable when the cost of a false fix is low.
* Temporal ghost fires only after two snapshots confirm the deletion. Useful for audit-grade evidence and for compound chains that need a low-false-positive primitive.
