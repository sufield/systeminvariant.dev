# Evaluation Engine Capabilities

This page inventories what the evaluation engine can express, not what the shipped catalog uses. The split matters: several operators and features were built for domains that the MVP catalog does not yet ship controls for (network reachability, identity chains, recurrence over time-series). They are tested and reachable — they just have no production caller today.

When a reference says *"used by S3 controls"* the feature has at least one shipped YAML invoking it; *"candidate"* means the engine supports it but no shipped control exercises it yet. Both kinds are stable: the engine surface is the contract, not the catalog's current usage.

## Predicate Operators[​](#predicate-operators "Direct link to Predicate Operators")

The closed vocabulary of operators the `unsafe_predicate` YAML can use. New operators require a code change; arbitrary user expressions are deliberately not supported.

| Op                       | Meaning                                                             | Exercised by shipped controls       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `eq`                     | Field equals literal                                                | Yes                                 |
| `ne`                     | Field differs from literal                                          | Yes                                 |
| `in`                     | Field value is one of a literal list                                | Yes                                 |
| `missing`                | Field is absent from the asset                                      | Yes                                 |
| `present`                | Field is set (non-null, non-empty)                                  | Yes                                 |
| `contains`               | Field's string / list contains a literal                            | Yes                                 |
| `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte` | Numeric comparison against a literal                                | Yes                                 |
| `any_match`              | At least one element of a list field matches a sub-predicate        | Yes                                 |
| `any_in_field`           | At least one element of list A is also in list B (intersection ≠ ∅) | Yes                                 |
| `not_subset_of_field`    | List A has at least one element not in list B                       | Yes (cross-account access controls) |

Each operator is single-purpose. Composite logic comes from `any` / `all` predicate nodes — not from operator overloading.

## Predicate Composition[​](#predicate-composition "Direct link to Predicate Composition")

Tree shape (`controls/*.yaml`):

```
unsafe_predicate:
  all:                    # AND
    - field: encryption.enabled
      op: eq
      value: false
    - any:                # OR
        - field: policy.principal
          op: eq
          value: "*"
        - field: acl.public_read
          op: eq
          value: true
```

* `all` — every child must hold (logical AND)
* `any` — at least one child must hold (logical OR)
* Leaves are field-op-value triples

Nesting is unrestricted; the engine evaluates depth-first with short-circuiting.

## Control Types[​](#control-types "Direct link to Control Types")

Every control declares a `type` that selects its evaluation strategy. The engine implements five:

| Type                | Status                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `unsafe_state`      | Used — the default; the large majority of shipped controls                               |
| `unsafe_duration`   | Used — multi-snapshot dwell measurement                                                  |
| `unsafe_recurrence` | Used — asset re-entering an unsafe state within a window                                 |
| `prefix_exposure`   | Used — violation when protected prefixes are publicly readable                           |
| `marker`            | Used — records an informational fact for chain composition; never a violation on its own |

The `ctrl.v1` schema rejects any `type` outside these five at load time. A control whose `type` is empty or otherwise unrecognized resolves to the internal `unknown` type, which has no strategy: it is **skipped**, not failed — it appears in `skipped_controls` with reason *"control type cannot be evaluated"*.

## Asset Evaluation[​](#asset-evaluation "Direct link to Asset Evaluation")

The engine binds an asset's `properties` map to CEL variables using dotted-path lookups (`storage.encryption.algorithm` → `properties.storage.encryption.algorithm`). Missing intermediate keys collapse to `missing` rather than runtime errors — so a control written against optional fields does not crash on assets that never set them.

| Feature                                         | Status                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dotted-path access into nested maps             | Used by all controls                                                                         |
| List indexing and `any_match` traversal         | Used by S3, IAM, DocumentDB                                                                  |
| Cross-field comparison within one asset         | Used (`not_subset_of_field`)                                                                 |
| Cross-asset evaluation (joins across snapshots) | **Candidate** — engine supports it via chain definitions, not exposed through `ctrl.v1` YAML |

## Time and Duration[​](#time-and-duration "Direct link to Time and Duration")

`unsafe_duration` controls measure how long an asset has been in an unsafe state across snapshots.

| Feature                                                                        | Status                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Single-snapshot evaluation (`unsafe_state`)                                    | Used                                                                   |
| Multi-snapshot duration measurement (`unsafe_duration`)                        | Used                                                                   |
| Approaching-threshold risk signals (configurable percentage of `--max-unsafe`) | Used                                                                   |
| Recurrence detection (asset re-entering unsafe state after exiting)            | **Candidate** — engine plumbing present; no shipped control invokes it |
| Time-of-day / business-hours windows                                           | Not implemented                                                        |

## Identity & Chain Evaluation[​](#identity--chain-evaluation "Direct link to Identity & Chain Evaluation")

Chains compose individual control findings into attack-path verdicts using a closed capability vocabulary (`audit_trail_destroyed`, `s3_data_access`, `iam_credential_theft`, etc., defined in `internal/core/capabilities/capabilities.go`).

| Feature                                         | Status                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Capability tagging on control findings          | Used (`compound_risk` definitions in chains)                                                                                     |
| Chain pre/post-condition evaluation             | Used (HIPAA compound chains, IAM privesc patterns)                                                                               |
| Identity reachability across roles and policies | **Candidate** — IAM blast-radius examples exercise this through the library API; no `ctrl.v1` control composes it as a chain yet |
| Multi-account capability propagation            | **Candidate** — exercised in `examples/iam-21-privesc-5-patterns/`, not in shipped chain YAML                                    |

## Output Surface[​](#output-surface "Direct link to Output Surface")

What the engine emits regardless of catalog domain.

| Output                                                                                          | Status |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| `findings[]` with control ID, asset ID, evidence                                                | Used   |
| `risk_signals[]` for approaching-threshold items                                                | Used   |
| `remediation_groups[]` clustering same-fix findings per asset                                   | Used   |
| Logic trace JSON (`apply --trace`) — step-by-step reasoning record                              | Used   |
| SARIF v2.1.0 export                                                                             | Used   |
| SIR fact export (`stave export-sir`) — JSON / JSONL / SMT-LIB v2 for external reasoning engines | Used   |
| Schema-validated outputs (`out.v0.1`, `diagnose.v1`)                                            | Used   |

## Why The Split Exists[​](#why-the-split-exists "Direct link to Why The Split Exists")

The candidate code is not dead code. It is reachable through the library API (`pkg/stave`) and exercised by the `examples/` programs. It is "candidate" in the sense that no shipped YAML control currently invokes it through the standard `stave apply` path. The split is intentional:

1. The catalog ships only what has fixtures, golden tests, and review sign-off as a shipped control.
2. The engine carries forward features built for domains the catalog will reach in MVP 1.0+ (network reachability, identity propagation, time-series recurrence).
3. New domains add controls, not engine changes — the engine is already broader than the catalog.

See [Limits](/docs/reference/limits.md) for the inverse — what the engine deliberately does not do.
