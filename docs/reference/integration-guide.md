# Integration Guide: Stave with Companion Tools

Stave evaluates offline JSON snapshots — it never holds cloud credentials. This means any tool that can produce JSON from cloud APIs can feed Stave's evaluation engine. This guide shows how.

## Quick Reference[​](#quick-reference "Direct link to Quick Reference")

| Combination        | Use Case                                                        |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stave + CloudQuery | Scheduled CI/CD snapshot collection for 300+ AWS resource types |
| Stave + Steampipe  | Ad-hoc queries, interactive exploration, coverage validation    |
| Stave + AWS Config | Zero new tooling for teams already running Config               |
| Stave standalone   | Built-in jq transform from raw AWS CLI output                   |

All paths produce the same `obs.v0.1` JSON. Stave's controls and compound chains evaluate identically regardless of how observations were created.

## Stave + CloudQuery[​](#stave--cloudquery "Direct link to Stave + CloudQuery")

**Problem:** Stave has controls for SageMaker, Bedrock, EKS, and 60+ other services but doesn't natively collect their API responses.

**Solution:** CloudQuery syncs AWS resources to a local database. Query the synced data, transform to obs.v0.1, evaluate with Stave.

### Setup[​](#setup "Direct link to Setup")

```
# Install CloudQuery
brew install cloudquery/tap/cloudquery

# Create sync config (aws.yml)
cat > aws.yml <<'YAML'
kind: source
spec:
  name: aws
  path: cloudquery/aws
  registry: cloudquery
  tables: ["aws_s3_buckets", "aws_iam_roles", "aws_iam_policies",
           "aws_ec2_instances", "aws_lambda_functions",
           "aws_sagemaker_notebook_instances"]
  destinations: ["sqlite"]
---
kind: destination
spec:
  name: sqlite
  path: cloudquery/sqlite
  registry: cloudquery
  spec:
    connection_string: ./cloudquery.db
YAML

# Sync
cloudquery sync aws.yml
```

### Transform and Evaluate[​](#transform-and-evaluate "Direct link to Transform and Evaluate")

```
# Extract S3 observations
sqlite3 -json cloudquery.db \
  "SELECT name, versioning_status, server_side_encryption_configuration,
          logging_target_bucket, block_public_acls, block_public_policy,
          ignore_public_acls, restrict_public_buckets
   FROM aws_s3_buckets" \
  | jq '{
      schema_version: "obs.v0.1",
      captured_at: (now | todate),
      source: "deployed",
      assets: [.[] | {
        id: .name,
        type: "aws_s3_bucket",
        vendor: "aws",
        properties: {
          storage: {
            kind: "bucket",
            name: .name,
            versioning: { enabled: (.versioning_status == "Enabled") },
            encryption: { at_rest_enabled: (.server_side_encryption_configuration != null) },
            logging: { enabled: (.logging_target_bucket != null) },
            controls: { public_access_fully_blocked: (
              .block_public_acls and .block_public_policy and
              .ignore_public_acls and .restrict_public_buckets
            )}
          }
        }
      }]
    }' > observations/s3-snap.json

# Evaluate
stave apply -o observations/
```

### Service Coverage[​](#service-coverage "Direct link to Service Coverage")

Run `stave services inspect <service>` to see which CloudQuery tables map to each service:

```
stave services inspect sagemaker
# Shows EXTERNAL COLLECTION SOURCES section with CloudQuery tables
```

12 services have CloudQuery table mappings in the registry: IAM, S3, EC2, Lambda, ECS, EKS, RDS, VPC, CloudTrail, KMS, SageMaker, Bedrock.

### CI/CD Pipeline[​](#cicd-pipeline "Direct link to CI/CD Pipeline")

```
# Nightly: sync → extract → evaluate → alert
cloudquery sync aws.yml
for svc in s3 iam ec2 lambda; do
  ./extractors/${svc}.sh > observations/${svc}-$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H%M%SZ).json
done
stave apply -o observations/ --format json > findings.json
```

## Stave + Steampipe[​](#stave--steampipe "Direct link to Stave + Steampipe")

**Problem:** You want to validate Stave's coverage against CIS benchmarks, or use Steampipe's 150+ plugins for ad-hoc extraction.

**Solution:** Steampipe exposes cloud APIs as SQL tables. Query directly, transform to obs.v0.1, evaluate with Stave.

### Setup[​](#setup-1 "Direct link to Setup")

```
steampipe plugin install aws
```

### Extract and Evaluate[​](#extract-and-evaluate "Direct link to Extract and Evaluate")

```
# Extract S3 observations via Steampipe
steampipe query --output json \
  "SELECT name, region, versioning_enabled,
          server_side_encryption_configuration,
          logging, acl, policy,
          public_access_block_configuration
   FROM aws_s3_bucket" \
  | jq '{
      schema_version: "obs.v0.1",
      captured_at: (now | todate),
      source: "deployed",
      assets: [.[] | {
        id: .name,
        type: "aws_s3_bucket",
        vendor: "aws",
        properties: {
          storage: {
            kind: "bucket",
            name: .name,
            versioning: { enabled: (.versioning_enabled // false) },
            encryption: { at_rest_enabled: (.server_side_encryption_configuration != null) },
            logging: { enabled: (.logging != null) },
            controls: { public_access_fully_blocked: (
              .public_access_block_configuration.BlockPublicAcls and
              .public_access_block_configuration.BlockPublicPolicy and
              .public_access_block_configuration.IgnorePublicAcls and
              .public_access_block_configuration.RestrictPublicBuckets
            )}
          }
        }
      }]
    }' > observations/s3-snap.json

stave apply -o observations/
```

### Coverage Validation[​](#coverage-validation "Direct link to Coverage Validation")

Run Steampipe CIS alongside Stave on the same account to compare:

```
# Steampipe findings
steampipe check benchmark.cis_v300 --output json > steampipe-cis.json

# Stave findings (same account snapshot)
stave apply -o observations/ --format json > stave-findings.json
```

**Expected differences:**

* Steampipe finds per-resource CIS checks (password policy, MFA, encryption settings). Stave covers most of these — run `stave catalog gaps .stave-backlog/checklists/cis-aws-v3.yaml` to see the mapping.
* Stave finds compound risks Steampipe cannot: privilege escalation chains, cross-service blast radius, data perimeter completeness, temporal configuration drift. These come from 622 compound chains that reason across resource relationships.

## Stave + AWS Config[​](#stave--aws-config "Direct link to Stave + AWS Config")

**Problem:** Your team already runs AWS Config and doesn't want additional tooling.

**Solution:** Export Config snapshots, transform to obs.v0.1.

```
aws configservice select-resource-config \
  --expression "SELECT resourceId, resourceType, configuration
                WHERE resourceType = 'AWS::S3::Bucket'" \
  --output json \
  | jq '{
      schema_version: "obs.v0.1",
      captured_at: (now | todate),
      source: "deployed",
      assets: [.Results[] | fromjson | {
        id: .resourceId,
        type: "aws_s3_bucket",
        vendor: "aws",
        properties: { storage: { kind: "bucket", name: .resourceId } }
      }]
    }' > observations/s3-snap.json

stave apply -o observations/
```

AWS Config covers 380+ resource types. Zero additional cost if Config is already deployed.

## Standalone Stave[​](#standalone-stave "Direct link to Standalone Stave")

No companion tools needed. Use the AWS CLI + jq:

```
# Capture raw API responses
aws s3api list-buckets > raw/s3-buckets.json
aws s3api get-bucket-versioning --bucket my-bucket >> raw/s3-versioning.json

# Transform to obs.v0.1
stave transform -i raw/ -o observations/

# Evaluate
stave apply -o observations/
```

The built-in `stave transform` handles common AWS services. For services without built-in transform support, use the extractor pattern documented in `docs/extractor-prompt.md`.

## Choosing a Companion Tool[​](#choosing-a-companion-tool "Direct link to Choosing a Companion Tool")

| Factor               | CloudQuery           | Steampipe              | AWS Config          | Standalone     |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- | -------------- |
| Setup effort         | Config file + sync   | Plugin install         | Already deployed    | None           |
| Best for             | CI/CD pipelines      | Ad-hoc queries         | Zero new tooling    | Quick start    |
| AWS coverage         | 300+ resource types  | 150+ tables            | 380+ types          | Per-service jq |
| Multi-cloud          | AWS, GCP, Azure, K8s | 150+ plugins           | AWS only            | AWS only       |
| Credential model     | Service account      | Interactive or service | IAM role            | CLI profile    |
| Historical snapshots | Database retention   | Point-in-time          | S3 delivery channel | Manual         |

Pick the tool your team already knows. Stave doesn't care how you produce obs.v0.1 — only that it conforms to the schema.
