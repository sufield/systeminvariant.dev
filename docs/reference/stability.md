# Stability and Versioning

## Schema Stability[​](#schema-stability "Direct link to Schema Stability")

| Schema       | Version    | Commitment                              |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Observations | `obs.v0.1` | Stable — no breaking changes within 1.x |
| Controls     | `ctrl.v1`  | Stable — no breaking changes within 1.x |
| Output       | `out.v0.1` | Stable — no breaking changes within 1.x |

Schema versions are independent of the CLI version. The `v0.1` designation indicates the initial stable schema. Breaking changes (if ever needed) would increment to `v0.2` with a migration guide.

Observations and controls are validated at runtime against embedded [JSON Schema Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) files (see `schemas/`). Output artifacts are also validated at runtime against embedded schemas (`out.v0.1`, `diagnose.v1`) before emission.

See [controls/MIGRATION.md](https://github.com/sufield/stave/blob/main/controls/MIGRATION.md) for migration guidance.

## Exit Code Stability[​](#exit-code-stability "Direct link to Exit Code Stability")

Exit codes are part of the public API and will not change within a major version:

| Code | Meaning                       | Stable? |
| ---- | ----------------------------- | ------- |
| 0    | Success / no violations       | Yes     |
| 1    | Security-audit gating failure | Yes     |
| 2    | Input or validation error     | Yes     |
| 3    | Violations detected           | Yes     |
| 4    | Internal error                | Yes     |
| 130  | Interrupted (SIGINT)          | Yes     |

Exit code 1 is not used for violations. Exit code 3 means violations.

## CLI Flag Stability[​](#cli-flag-stability "Direct link to CLI Flag Stability")

Flags documented in the README and command help are stable. Undocumented flags may change without notice.

## Output Format Stability[​](#output-format-stability "Direct link to Output Format Stability")

JSON output fields in `run`, `summary`, and `findings` are stable within a major version. New fields may be added (additive changes are not breaking). No fields will be removed or renamed within 1.x.

## Pinned Dependencies[​](#pinned-dependencies "Direct link to Pinned Dependencies")

Stave pins all dependencies to exact versions. The source of truth is the Go module file (`go.mod`) and the project's version policy.

| Dependency    | Version | Role                 |
| ------------- | ------- | -------------------- |
| Go            | 1.26.4  | Build toolchain      |
| Cobra         | v1.10.2 | CLI framework        |
| pflag         | v1.0.10 | Flag parsing         |
| yaml.v3       | v3.0.1  | Control YAML parsing |
| golangci-lint | v2.8.0  | CI linting           |

Dependency updates go through CI checks including govulncheck and license compliance (`go-licenses check`). Forbidden licenses (GPL, AGPL, SSPL, LGPL) fail the build.

## Build Reproducibility[​](#build-reproducibility "Direct link to Build Reproducibility")

Release binaries are reproducible. Anyone with the matching Go version can rebuild from source and compare checksums:

* `CGO_ENABLED=0` — pure Go, no C dependencies
* `-trimpath` — removes local filesystem paths
* `-buildid=` — removes build ID
* `-ldflags "-s -w"` — strips debug symbols

See [Release Security](/docs/explanation/release-security.md#reproducible-builds) for instructions.

## Supported Platforms[​](#supported-platforms "Direct link to Supported Platforms")

| OS      | Architecture                         |
| ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Linux   | amd64, arm64                         |
| macOS   | amd64 (Intel), arm64 (Apple Silicon) |
| Windows | amd64                                |

## Deprecation Policy[​](#deprecation-policy "Direct link to Deprecation Policy")

Before removing a flag, command, or output field:

1. The item is marked deprecated in help text for at least one minor release.
2. A migration path is documented.
3. The removal is noted in the changelog.

## Documentation Versioning Policy[​](#documentation-versioning-policy "Direct link to Documentation Versioning Policy")

Documentation is versioned with source code in this repository.

* Docs updates for user-visible behavior changes must land in the same PR.
* `CHANGELOG.md` is the release-facing summary for docs and code changes.
* CLI reference pages are generated from command definitions to reduce drift.
* Docs are validated by CI link checks.
