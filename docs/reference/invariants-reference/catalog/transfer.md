### CTL.TRANSFER.EXTERNAL.DESTINATION.001[​](#ctltransferexternaldestination001 "Direct link to CTL.TRANSFER.EXTERNAL.DESTINATION.001")

**Transfer Family Must Not Send Data to External Endpoints**

* **Severity:** high
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** exposure
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: AC-3; soc2: CC6.1;

No Transfer Family server should have workflow steps that target S3 buckets or EFS in external accounts, or SFTP/FTP destinations at external hosts. Transfer Family provides managed file transfer — an attacker can configure it to deliver files to an external SFTP server. Linked to Muddled Libra campaigns (2024) documented by Wiz. Technique: Wiz "Exfiltration via AWS Transfer".

**Remediation:** Verify the destination is legitimate. If not, remove the workflow step immediately. Restrict transfer:CreateWorkflow via SCP.

### CTL.TRANSFER.SECPOLICY.LEGACY.001[​](#ctltransfersecpolicylegacy001 "Direct link to CTL.TRANSFER.SECPOLICY.LEGACY.001")

**Transfer Family Server Must Not Use Legacy Security Policy**

* **Severity:** high
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** exposure
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: SC-8, SC-13; pci\_dss\_v4.0: 4.2; soc2: CC6.1, CC6.7;

AWS Transfer Family servers must use a current security policy, not a legacy policy such as TransferSecurityPolicy-2018-11. Legacy policies include weak cipher suites (CBC-mode ciphers, SHA1-based MACs) and may permit TLS 1.0 negotiation. AWS publishes updated security policies that remove deprecated ciphers; servers pinned to old policies expose file transfer sessions to downgrade risks. SFTP, FTPS, and FTP-over-TLS sessions carry credentials and file contents — weak cipher negotiation on the transfer endpoint is a direct data exposure vector. The same pattern as CTL.APIGATEWAY.DOMAIN.TLS.POLICY.STALE.001 and CTL.ELB.TLS.CUSTOM.WEAKCIPHER.001.

**Remediation:** Update the server security policy to the current AWS recommendation: aws transfer update-server --server-id --security-policy-name TransferSecurityPolicy-2024-01. Verify that all SFTP/FTPS clients can negotiate with the modern cipher list before switching production servers. Older clients may require TLS-stack upgrades.
