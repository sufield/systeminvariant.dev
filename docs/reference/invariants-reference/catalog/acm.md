### CTL.ACM.ACME.SCOPE.WILDCARD.001[​](#ctlacmacmescopewildcard001 "Direct link to CTL.ACM.ACME.SCOPE.WILDCARD.001")

**ACM ACME Endpoint Domain Scope Must Not Use Wildcards**

* **Severity:** medium
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** governance
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: AC-6; soc2: CC6.1;

ACM ACME endpoint domain scope must not contain wildcard patterns. An ACME endpoint scoped to \*.example.com allows any authorized ACME client to request certificates for any subdomain. If the endpoint serves a single application (app.example.com), the wildcard scope is a blast-radius amplifier: a compromised ACME client can issue certificates for domains it should not control. Exact domain names in the scope field limit issuance to the intended services.

**Remediation:** Restrict the ACME endpoint's domain scope to the specific domains that need certificate issuance. Replace \*.example.com with the exact domain names (app.example.com, api.example.com). If wildcard scope is operationally required, document the justification and tighten IAM policies on the endpoint to limit which principals can request certificates.

### CTL.ACM.ACME.SPRAWL.001[​](#ctlacmacmesprawl001 "Direct link to CTL.ACM.ACME.SPRAWL.001")

**Account Has Excessive ACM ACME Endpoints**

* **Severity:** low
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** governance
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: CM-8; soc2: CC8.1;

Account has more ACME endpoints than the governance threshold. Each ACME endpoint is an independent certificate issuance point with its own domain scope, wildcard policy, and client access. Without centralized governance, application teams create endpoints ad hoc — each with different policies, different scopes, and different levels of oversight. The resulting sprawl makes certificate issuance unauditable: no single team knows which endpoints exist, what domains they cover, or who has access. Same accumulation pattern as CTL.SQS.POLICY.SPRAWL.001. The threshold is a heuristic; adjust per organization size.

**Remediation:** Audit existing ACME endpoints and consolidate where possible. Establish a naming convention and tagging policy for ACME endpoints. Consider a central platform team that provisions endpoints with approved domain scopes and wildcard policies, rather than allowing each application team to create its own.

### CTL.ACM.ACME.WILDCARD.001[​](#ctlacmacmewildcard001 "Direct link to CTL.ACM.ACME.WILDCARD.001")

**ACM ACME Endpoint Must Not Allow Wildcard Certificate Issuance**

* **Severity:** medium
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** governance
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: SC-12; pci\_dss\_v4.0: 4.2.1; soc2: CC6.7;

ACM ACME endpoint must not permit wildcard certificate issuance. A wildcard certificate (\*.example.com) covers every subdomain under the parent domain. One compromised private key or one leaked certificate exposes every subdomain to impersonation. ACME endpoints can enforce policies on wildcard usage — disabling wildcard issuance forces per-subdomain certificates, limiting blast radius to the single service whose key is compromised.

**Remediation:** Set the endpoint's wildcard policy to DENY. Issue individual certificates for each subdomain instead of wildcard certificates. If wildcard issuance is operationally required (e.g., a CDN serving many subdomains), document the justification, ensure the private key is stored in a hardware security module, and monitor Certificate Transparency logs for unexpected issuance.

### CTL.ACM.CERT.EXPIRY.001[​](#ctlacmcertexpiry001 "Direct link to CTL.ACM.CERT.EXPIRY.001")

**ACM Imported Certificates Must Not Be Near Expiry**

* **Severity:** high
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** exposure
* **Compliance:** fedramp\_moderate: SC-12; hipaa: 164.312(e)(2)(ii); nist\_800\_53\_r5: SC-12; owasp\_nhi: NHI7; pci\_dss\_v4.0: 4.2.1; soc2: CC6.7;

SSL/TLS certificates imported into ACM must not be within 30 days of expiry or already expired. ACM automatically renews certificates it provisions (AMAZON\_ISSUED) but does not renew imported certificates. Imported certificates expire silently on their expiry date with no enforcement mechanism — services continue serving traffic on an expired certificate until clients reject it. An expired certificate on a production load balancer or CloudFront distribution causes TLS negotiation failures for all clients that enforce certificate validity. For HIPAA and PCI-DSS environments, serving traffic on an expired certificate is a direct compliance violation. This control evaluates only IMPORTED certificates — AMAZON\_ISSUED certificates are auto-renewed and out of scope.

**Remediation:** Renew or replace the imported certificate. Import the new certificate into ACM via aws acm import-certificate. If the certificate was originally from a private CA, re-issue from the CA and re-import. Consider migrating to an ACM-managed certificate (AMAZON\_ISSUED) for automatic renewal — ACM provisions free public certificates for domains validated via DNS or email. After importing the new certificate, verify the associated services (load balancers, CloudFront distributions, API Gateway domains) are serving the updated certificate.

### CTL.ACM.CERT.VALIDATION.001[​](#ctlacmcertvalidation001 "Direct link to CTL.ACM.CERT.VALIDATION.001")

**ACM Certificates Must Use DNS Validation**

* **Severity:** low
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** exposure
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: SC-17; scs\_c02: 6.2; soc2: CC6.1;

ACM certificates should use DNS validation, not email validation. Email validation requires manual intervention for each renewal — if the domain contact email is stale, renewal fails silently and the certificate expires. DNS validation enables automatic renewal as long as the CNAME record exists, eliminating human-dependent renewal processes.

**Remediation:** Re-request the certificate with DNS validation. Add the CNAME record ACM provides to your DNS zone. This enables automatic renewal without human intervention.

### CTL.ACM.KEY.ALGORITHM.001[​](#ctlacmkeyalgorithm001 "Direct link to CTL.ACM.KEY.ALGORITHM.001")

**ACM Certificates Must Use Strong Key Algorithms**

* **Severity:** high
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** encryption
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: SC-13; soc2: CC6.7;

ACM certificates must use RSA-2048+ or ECDSA P-256+ key algorithms. Weak algorithms (RSA-1024, ECDSA P-192) are vulnerable to factoring or discrete logarithm attacks.

**Remediation:** Request a new certificate with RSA-2048 or ECDSA P-256.

***

### CTL.ACM.RENEWAL.001[​](#ctlacmrenewal001 "Direct link to CTL.ACM.RENEWAL.001")

**ACM Certificate Renewal Must Not Be In Failed State**

* **Severity:** high
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** exposure
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: SC-12; pci\_dss\_v4.0: 4.2.1; soc2: CC6.7;

ACM-managed certificates must not be in a failed renewal state. When ACM cannot auto-renew a certificate (DNS validation record removed, domain no longer resolves, CAA record blocks issuance), the certificate will expire on its expiry date. A failed renewal requires manual intervention — the certificate will not self-heal.

**Remediation:** Check the renewal status: aws acm describe-certificate. Common causes: DNS CNAME validation record was deleted, domain DNS is not resolving, CAA record blocks ACM issuance. Fix the underlying cause and ACM will retry renewal automatically.

***

### CTL.ACM.TRANSPARENCY.001[​](#ctlacmtransparency001 "Direct link to CTL.ACM.TRANSPARENCY.001")

**ACM Certificates Must Enable Certificate Transparency Logging**

* **Severity:** medium
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** exposure
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: AU-2; soc2: CC7.1;

ACM-issued certificates must have Certificate Transparency (CT) logging enabled. CT logging publishes certificates to public logs, enabling detection of unauthorized certificate issuance for the domain.

**Remediation:** Enable CT logging when requesting or renewing the certificate.
