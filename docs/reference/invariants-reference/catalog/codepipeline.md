### CTL.CODEPIPELINE.ARTIFACT.NOENCRYPT.001[​](#ctlcodepipelineartifactnoencrypt001 "Direct link to CTL.CODEPIPELINE.ARTIFACT.NOENCRYPT.001")

**CodePipeline Artifact Store Must Use KMS Encryption**

* **Severity:** medium
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** exposure
* **Compliance:** hipaa: 164.312(a)(2)(iv); nist\_800\_53\_r5: SC-28; soc2: CC6.1;

CodePipeline artifact store must use a customer-managed KMS key. Without encryption, build artifacts — source code archives, compiled binaries, test results, deployment packages — are stored in plaintext in S3. Anyone with read access to the artifact bucket can access every version of every artifact the pipeline produced.

**Remediation:** Configure the pipeline's artifactStore with an encryptionKey pointing to a customer-managed KMS key ARN. This encrypts all artifacts at rest and gives the organization control over key rotation and access policies.

### CTL.CODEPIPELINE.GHOST.ARTIFACT.S3.001[​](#ctlcodepipelineghostartifacts3001 "Direct link to CTL.CODEPIPELINE.GHOST.ARTIFACT.S3.001")

**CodePipeline Artifact Store S3 Bucket Deleted**

* **Severity:** high
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** exposure
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: SA-10, SC-28; soc2: CC6.1, CC8.1;

CodePipeline artifact store references an S3 bucket that has been deleted. Pipeline executions fail because artifacts cannot be stored or retrieved. If the bucket is re-registered under a different account, build artifacts — source code, compiled binaries, deployment packages — are written to attacker storage.

**Remediation:** Update the pipeline artifact store to an existing bucket: aws codepipeline update-pipeline --pipeline file://pipeline.json (set artifactStore.location to a valid bucket).

### CTL.CODEPIPELINE.NOAPPROVAL.001[​](#ctlcodepipelinenoapproval001 "Direct link to CTL.CODEPIPELINE.NOAPPROVAL.001")

**CodePipeline Must Have Manual Approval Before Production Deploy**

* **Severity:** high
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** governance
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: CM-3; pci\_dss\_v4.0: 6.5.4; soc2: CC8.1;

CodePipeline that deploys to production must include a manual approval action. Without a human gate, a compromised source repository or build stage can push adversarial code directly to production — a SageMaker endpoint, ECS service, or Lambda function — with no review step.

**Remediation:** Add a Manual Approval action before any stage that deploys to production. Configure an SNS topic for approval notifications so the right team is notified. This creates a human checkpoint between build and deploy.

### CTL.CODEPIPELINE.OVERPERM.001[​](#ctlcodepipelineoverperm001 "Direct link to CTL.CODEPIPELINE.OVERPERM.001")

**CodePipeline Role Must Follow Least Privilege**

* **Severity:** high
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** identity
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: AC-6; owasp\_nhi: NHI5; soc2: CC6.1;

CodePipeline execution roles must be scoped to the minimum permissions required for each stage. An overprivileged pipeline role lets any stage action — including actions triggered by external source events — access resources beyond the pipeline's scope: deploying to production, modifying IAM policies, or reading secrets the pipeline does not need.

**Remediation:** Scope the execution role to the minimum permissions per stage: source pull, build trigger, artifact read/write, and deploy actions. Use per-action role overrides where possible. Remove iam:PassRole on *, s3:*, and sagemaker:\* from the pipeline role.

### CTL.CODEPIPELINE.V1.001[​](#ctlcodepipelinev1001 "Direct link to CTL.CODEPIPELINE.V1.001")

**CodePipeline Must Use V2 Pipeline Type**

* **Severity:** low
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** governance
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: SA-22;

CodePipeline must use the V2 pipeline type. V1 is feature-frozen and lacks V2 improvements: pipeline-level variables, Git tags as triggers, and QUEUED/PARALLEL execution modes. V1 pipelines also lack the full CloudWatch Events integration that V2 uses for change detection, falling back to polling — which is both slower and less auditable.

**Remediation:** Migrate to V2 pipeline type. Create a new V2 pipeline with the same stages and actions, verify execution, then delete the V1 pipeline. V2 is backward-compatible with V1 stage/action definitions.
