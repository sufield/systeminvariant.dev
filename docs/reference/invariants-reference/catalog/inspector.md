# INSPECTOR controls (3)

### CTL.INSPECTOR.COVERAGE.001[​](#ctlinspectorcoverage001 "Direct link to CTL.INSPECTOR.COVERAGE.001")

**Amazon Inspector Must Cover All Scan Types**

* **Severity:** high
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** exposure
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: RA-5; pci\_dss\_v4.0: 11.3.1; soc2: CC7.1;

Amazon Inspector must have all available scan types enabled — EC2 scanning, ECR container scanning, Lambda function scanning, and Lambda code scanning. Each scan type covers a different attack surface. EC2 scanning detects OS-level CVEs, ECR scanning finds container image vulnerabilities, Lambda scanning identifies dependency vulnerabilities in function code. Partial coverage leaves entire resource classes unscanned.

**Remediation:** Enable all scan types in Inspector. Use aws inspector2 enable --resource-types EC2 ECR LAMBDA LAMBDA\_CODE to enable all supported scan types.

### CTL.INSPECTOR.DELEGATED.001[​](#ctlinspectordelegated001 "Direct link to CTL.INSPECTOR.DELEGATED.001")

**Inspector Delegated Administrator Must Be Configured**

* **Severity:** medium
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** exposure
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: RA-5; soc2: CC7.1;

Amazon Inspector must have a delegated administrator configured in AWS Organizations for centralized vulnerability management. Without delegation, each account manages Inspector independently — scan results are fragmented, no single team has visibility into organization-wide vulnerabilities, and coverage gaps go undetected.

**Remediation:** Designate a delegated administrator: aws inspector2 enable-delegated-admin-account --delegated-admin-account-id

### CTL.INSPECTOR.ENABLED.001[​](#ctlinspectorenabled001 "Direct link to CTL.INSPECTOR.ENABLED.001")

**Amazon Inspector Must Be Enabled**

* **Severity:** medium
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** exposure
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: RA-5; soc2: CC7.1;

Amazon Inspector 2 must be enabled for vulnerability scanning of EC2, ECR, and Lambda resources. Without Inspector, known vulnerabilities in deployed software go undetected.

**Remediation:** Enable Inspector 2 for EC2, ECR, and Lambda scanning.
