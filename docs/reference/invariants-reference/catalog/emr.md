### CTL.EMR.ENCRYPT.001[​](#ctlemrencrypt001 "Direct link to CTL.EMR.ENCRYPT.001")

**EMR Clusters Must Use a Security Configuration for Encryption**

* **Severity:** high
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** encryption
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: SC-28; soc2: CC6.7;

EMR clusters must have a security configuration enabling encryption at rest (EMRFS S3, local disk) and in transit (TLS). Without a security configuration, data processed by Spark and Hadoop jobs is stored and transmitted in plaintext.

**Remediation:** Create an EMR security configuration with encryption enabled for at-rest (S3 via EMRFS, local disk via LUKS) and in-transit (TLS) and attach it to the cluster.

### CTL.EMR.LOG.001[​](#ctlemrlog001 "Direct link to CTL.EMR.LOG.001")

**EMR Clusters Must Have Logging Enabled**

* **Severity:** medium
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** exposure
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: AU-2; soc2: CC7.1;

EMR clusters must enable logging to S3 for cluster events, step execution, and application logs. Without logging, job failures, security events, and data access patterns are invisible.

**Remediation:** Enable logging with an S3 log URI when creating or updating the cluster.

### CTL.EMR.PRIVATE.SUBNET.001[​](#ctlemrprivatesubnet001 "Direct link to CTL.EMR.PRIVATE.SUBNET.001")

**EMR Cluster Must Be Provisioned in Private VPC Subnet**

* **Severity:** high
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** exposure
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: SC-7; pci\_dss\_v4.0: 1.3.1; soc2: CC6.6;

EMR clusters must be provisioned in private VPC subnets (subnets without a route to an internet gateway). A cluster in a public subnet — even without public IPs on nodes — can be reached via the internet gateway if security groups allow it. Private subnets ensure the cluster is reachable only through VPN, Direct Connect, or VPC peering, not from the public internet.

**Remediation:** Recreate the cluster in a private subnet. Configure a NAT gateway or VPC endpoints for S3 and other AWS service access. Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager or a bastion host for administrative access.

***

### CTL.EMR.PUBLIC.BLOCK.001[​](#ctlemrpublicblock001 "Direct link to CTL.EMR.PUBLIC.BLOCK.001")

**EMR Account Must Enable Block Public Access**

* **Severity:** high
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** exposure
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: SC-7; soc2: CC6.6;

The EMR account-level Block Public Access setting must be enabled. When enabled, clusters cannot use security groups with inbound rules allowing public sources (0.0.0.0/0, ::/0) except on explicitly permitted ports.

**Remediation:** Enable Block Public Access in the EMR console or via aws emr put-block-public-access-configuration.

***

### CTL.EMR.PUBLIC.IP.001[​](#ctlemrpublicip001 "Direct link to CTL.EMR.PUBLIC.IP.001")

**EMR Cluster Nodes Must Not Have Public IP Addresses**

* **Severity:** medium
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** exposure
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: SC-7; soc2: CC6.6;

EMR cluster nodes (master and worker) must not have public IP addresses assigned. Public IPs make cluster nodes directly reachable from the internet, exposing Hadoop, Spark, and YARN management interfaces.

**Remediation:** Launch clusters in private subnets without public IP assignment. Use a bastion host or VPN for administrative access.

***

### CTL.EMR.PUBLIC.SG.001[​](#ctlemrpublicsg001 "Direct link to CTL.EMR.PUBLIC.SG.001")

**EMR Cluster Security Groups Must Not Allow Public Inbound**

* **Severity:** medium
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** exposure
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: SC-7; soc2: CC6.6;

Security groups attached to EMR cluster nodes must not have inbound rules allowing traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0. Open security groups expose Hadoop, Spark, and YARN interfaces to the internet.

**Remediation:** Restrict security group inbound rules to specific CIDR ranges or security group IDs. Remove 0.0.0.0/0 and ::/0 rules.

***

### CTL.EMR.RELEASE.EOL.001[​](#ctlemrreleaseeol001 "Direct link to CTL.EMR.RELEASE.EOL.001")

**EMR Clusters Must Not Use End-of-Life Release Labels**

* **Severity:** high
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** exposure
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: SI-2; pci\_dss\_v4.0: 6.3.3; soc2: CC7.1;

EMR clusters must not run release labels that have reached end-of-life. AWS publishes support timelines for EMR release series; the emr-5.x series is approaching full EOL, and early emr-6.x releases (6.0-6.3) are past support. EOL release labels include outdated versions of Spark, Hadoop, Hive, and Presto with known CVEs. EMR clusters process data at scale — an unpatched Spark or Hadoop version on the data plane is a direct exposure for any data the cluster reads, transforms, or writes. This is distinct from CTL.EMR.ENCRYPT.001 which checks encryption configuration; an encrypted but unpatched cluster still runs vulnerable processing code.

**Remediation:** Launch new clusters with a supported release label (emr-7.x or latest emr-6.x). Migrate running workflows to the new release. Test Spark/Hive jobs against the new release in a non-production cluster first — major release upgrades may change default configurations, deprecate APIs, or alter SQL behavior.
