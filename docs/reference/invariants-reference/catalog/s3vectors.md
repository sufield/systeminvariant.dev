### CTL.S3VECTORS.ACCESS.EXTERNAL.001[​](#ctls3vectorsaccessexternal001 "Direct link to CTL.S3VECTORS.ACCESS.EXTERNAL.001")

**No Unauthorized External Access to Vector Buckets**

* **Severity:** high
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** exposure
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: AC-3; soc2: CC6.3;

Vector Bucket policies must not grant access to external AWS accounts without organization-scoping conditions. The s3vectors: IAM namespace is separate from s3:, so s3:-scoped RCPs that enforce data perimeters do not cover Vector Buckets.

**Remediation:** Remove external account access or add aws:PrincipalOrgID condition. Verify s3vectors:-scoped SCP/RCP coverage exists.

### CTL.S3VECTORS.POLICY.CROSSACCOUNT.001[​](#ctls3vectorspolicycrossaccount001 "Direct link to CTL.S3VECTORS.POLICY.CROSSACCOUNT.001")

**Vector Bucket Policy Must Restrict Cross-Account Access**

* **Severity:** high
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** exposure
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: AC-3; soc2: CC6.3;

Vector Bucket policies granting cross-account access must include an aws:PrincipalOrgID condition. The s3vectors: namespace is separate from s3:, so RCPs scoped to s3:\* that enforce PrincipalOrgID do not cover Vector Buckets. An unscoped cross-account grant exposes embedding data to external principals.

**Remediation:** Add aws:PrincipalOrgID condition to all Allow statements that grant access to external accounts.

### CTL.S3VECTORS.POLICY.PUBLIC.001[​](#ctls3vectorspolicypublic001 "Direct link to CTL.S3VECTORS.POLICY.PUBLIC.001")

**Vector Bucket Policy Must Not Permit Public Access**

* **Severity:** critical
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** exposure
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: AC-3; soc2: CC6.1;

S3 Vectors Vector Bucket policies must not grant access to anonymous or wildcard principals. Vector Buckets use the s3vectors: IAM namespace, which is separate from s3:. Organization-level S3 Block Public Access and RCPs scoped to s3:\* do not cover s3vectors: actions. A public policy on a Vector Bucket exposes vector indexes and the data they encode — embedding vectors can leak the semantic content of the source documents.

**Remediation:** Remove wildcard Principal statements from the Vector Bucket policy. Add aws:PrincipalOrgID condition. Verify SCP/RCP coverage for s3vectors: actions exists independently.
