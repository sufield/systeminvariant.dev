**Permission Scope Must Not Widen After Resource Deletion**

* **Severity:** medium
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** governance
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: AC-6; soc2: CC6.1;

When a policy's Resource pattern changes from a specific ARN to a broader wildcard pattern between snapshots, and a resource deletion occurred in the same window, this indicates a ghost reference was "fixed" by widening permissions. The result is broader access than before the deletion — a scope expansion disguised as cleanup.

**Remediation:** Replace the wildcard pattern with specific ARNs for the intended resources. Do not widen permissions to fix dangling references.

### CTL.GHOST.TEMPORAL.RESOURCE.001[​](#ctlghosttemporalresource001 "Direct link to CTL.GHOST.TEMPORAL.RESOURCE.001")

**Resources Deleted Between Snapshots Must Not Have Persisting References**

* **Severity:** high
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** governance
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: CM-8; soc2: CC6.1;

When a resource is present in snapshot N-1 but absent in snapshot N, all references to that resource's ARN must also be removed in snapshot N. A resource confirmed deleted by two independent observations (present then absent) with persisting references is the highest-confidence ghost finding — not an extractor gap but a verified deletion with orphaned references. The severity inherits from the reference type: write permissions to reclaimable resources are critical, monitoring targets are critical, read permissions are high, and configuration references are medium.

**Remediation:** Remove all references to the deleted resource's ARN from policies, triggers, configurations, and compute definitions.
