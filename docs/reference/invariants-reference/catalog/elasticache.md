### CTL.ELASTICACHE.AUTH.001[​](#ctlelasticacheauth001 "Direct link to CTL.ELASTICACHE.AUTH.001")

**Redis AUTH Token Must Be Set**

* **Severity:** high
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** exposure
* **Compliance:** fedramp\_moderate: AC-3; nist\_800\_53\_r5: AC-3; pci\_dss\_v4.0: 7.2.1; soc2: CC6.1;

ElastiCache Redis clusters must have an AUTH token configured. Without AUTH, any client with network access can read and write data. Combined with a missing VPC or open security group, this creates an unauthenticated database exposure — the same pattern as the Darkbeam Elasticsearch breach.

**Remediation:** Set an AUTH token using aws elasticache modify-replication-group --auth-token. Ensure transit encryption is also enabled (required for AUTH). Rotate the token periodically.

### CTL.ELASTICACHE.BACKUP.001[​](#ctlelasticachebackup001 "Direct link to CTL.ELASTICACHE.BACKUP.001")

**ElastiCache Redis Automatic Backups Must Be Enabled**

* **Severity:** medium
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** resilience
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: CP-9; soc2: CC7.1;

ElastiCache Redis replication groups must have automatic backups enabled with a retention period of at least 1 day. Without automatic backups, a node failure, accidental FLUSHALL, or ransomware event destroys all cached data with no recovery path. ElastiCache backups are RDB snapshots stored in S3 — they capture the full dataset at a point in time and can restore to a new replication group. A retention period of 0 disables automatic backups entirely. Every comparable database service (RDS, DocumentDB, Neptune, DynamoDB) enforces automated backups; ElastiCache Redis supports them but does not enable them by default.

**Remediation:** Enable automatic backups by setting the snapshot retention limit to at least 1 day: aws elasticache modify-replication-group --replication-group-id --snapshot-retention-limit 7 --apply-immediately. For compliance workloads, set retention to match your RPO requirement (max 35 days).

### CTL.ELASTICACHE.ENCRYPT.REST.001[​](#ctlelasticacheencryptrest001 "Direct link to CTL.ELASTICACHE.ENCRYPT.REST.001")

**ElastiCache Redis Must Have At-Rest Encryption Enabled**

* **Severity:** high
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** exposure
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: SC-28; pci\_dss\_v4.0: 3.4.1; soc2: CC6.7;

ElastiCache Redis clusters must have at-rest encryption enabled to protect cached data (sessions, credentials, application state) stored on disk.

**Remediation:** Create a new cluster with at-rest encryption enabled (cannot be changed on existing clusters).

### CTL.ELASTICACHE.ENGINE.EOL.001[​](#ctlelasticacheengineeol001 "Direct link to CTL.ELASTICACHE.ENGINE.EOL.001")

**ElastiCache Engine Version Must Not Be End-of-Life**

* **Severity:** high
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** exposure
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: SI-2; pci\_dss\_v4.0: 6.3.3; soc2: CC7.1;

ElastiCache clusters must not run engine versions that have reached end-of-life. AWS publishes a deprecation calendar per engine major version; clusters on a deprecated version no longer receive security patches and will eventually be force-upgraded during a maintenance window the operator did not choose. Redis 5.x reached EOL in 2024, Redis 6.0 in 2024, and Redis 6.2 is approaching EOL. Memcached 1.5.x is EOL. Unlike RDS, ElastiCache does not have a separate auto-minor-upgrade toggle — the engine version is the sole indicator of patch currency. Running an EOL engine version means known CVEs in the cache layer remain unpatched, and any data transiting the cache (session tokens, API responses, feature flags) is processed by unmaintained code.

**Remediation:** Upgrade the cluster to a supported engine version. For Redis, upgrade to Redis 7.x. For Memcached, upgrade to 1.6.x. Use aws elasticache modify-replication-group --engine-version with a scheduled maintenance window to minimize impact. Test application compatibility with the new engine version before upgrading production — major version upgrades may change command behavior or remove deprecated commands.

### CTL.ELASTICACHE.INCOMPLETE.001[​](#ctlelasticacheincomplete001 "Direct link to CTL.ELASTICACHE.INCOMPLETE.001")

**Complete Data Required for ElastiCache Assessment**

* **Severity:** info
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** exposure

The observation snapshot is missing required ElastiCache properties.

**Remediation:** Ensure the extractor calls aws elasticache describe-replication-groups and maps TransitEncryptionEnabled to the cache observation properties.

### CTL.ELASTICACHE.MEMCACHED.EOL.001[​](#ctlelasticachememcachedeol001 "Direct link to CTL.ELASTICACHE.MEMCACHED.EOL.001")

**ElastiCache Memcached Version Must Not Be End-of-Life**

* **Severity:** medium
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** exposure
* **Compliance:** nist\_800\_53\_r5: SI-2; pci\_dss\_v4.0: 6.3.3; soc2: CC7.1;

ElastiCache Memcached clusters must not run engine versions that have reached end-of-life. Memcached 1.5.x and earlier are EOL and no longer receive security patches from AWS. Unlike Redis, Memcached has no authentication layer — the only protection is network isolation, making patch currency critical. A Memcached cluster on an EOL version processes cached data (session tokens, API responses) with unmaintained code. AWS will eventually force-upgrade clusters on deprecated versions during a maintenance window the operator did not schedule.

**Remediation:** Upgrade the cluster to Memcached 1.6.x. Use aws elasticache modify-cache-cluster --engine-version 1.6.22 with a scheduled maintenance window. Memcached major version upgrades are generally backward compatible — test your application's cache client against 1.6.x before upgrading production.

### CTL.ELASTICACHE.TRANSIT.001[​](#ctlelasticachetransit001 "Direct link to CTL.ELASTICACHE.TRANSIT.001")

**ElastiCache Must Have In-Transit Encryption Enabled**

* **Severity:** high
* **Type:** unsafe\_state
* **Domain:** exposure
* **Compliance:** fedramp\_moderate: SC-8; gdpr: Art.32; hipaa: 164.312(e)(2)(ii); nist\_800\_53\_r5: SC-8; pci\_dss\_v4.0: 4.2.1; soc2: CC6.6;

ElastiCache clusters must have in-transit encryption enabled. Without TLS, cache traffic travels in plaintext between the application and the cache nodes, exposing cached PHI data.

**Remediation:** In-transit encryption can only be enabled at cluster creation. Create a new replication group with TransitEncryptionEnabled=true and migrate data from the existing cluster.
