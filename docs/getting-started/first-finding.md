# Time To First Finding

Get your first finding against your own AWS environment in under 10 minutes.

No agents, no credentials stored by Stave, no network calls during evaluation. You extract the data yourself with the AWS CLI, then Stave evaluates it offline.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* `stave` installed and on `PATH`
* AWS CLI configured with read access to the target account
* Optional: `jq` installed (for extracting observation data)
* If jq is not installed, you can use JMES path that is part of AWS CLI

## Step 1: Extract a snapshot from your AWS account[​](#step-1-extract-a-snapshot-from-your-aws-account "Direct link to Step 1: Extract a snapshot from your AWS account")

Use the AWS CLI to pull S3 bucket configuration into a local directory. This is your extractor — a few shell commands you control.

```
mkdir -p snapshot-raw
aws s3api list-buckets > snapshot-raw/list-buckets.json
for bucket in $(jq -r '.Buckets[].Name' snapshot-raw/list-buckets.json); do
  aws s3api get-public-access-block --bucket "$bucket" > "snapshot-raw/${bucket}-pab.json" 2>/dev/null || true
  aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket "$bucket" > "snapshot-raw/${bucket}-acl.json" 2>/dev/null || true
  aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket "$bucket" > "snapshot-raw/${bucket}-policy.json" 2>/dev/null || true
  aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket "$bucket" > "snapshot-raw/${bucket}-encryption.json" 2>/dev/null || true
  aws s3api get-bucket-logging --bucket "$bucket" > "snapshot-raw/${bucket}-logging.json" 2>/dev/null || true
  aws s3api get-bucket-versioning --bucket "$bucket" > "snapshot-raw/${bucket}-versioning.json" 2>/dev/null || true
done
```

This runs in your terminal. Stave never sees your credentials.

## Step 2: Convert the snapshot into observations[​](#step-2-convert-the-snapshot-into-observations "Direct link to Step 2: Convert the snapshot into observations")

Convert the raw AWS CLI output into Stave's normalized observation format (`obs.v0.1` JSON). The built-in `stave transform` does this with jq filters — no extractor to write:

```
stave transform -i ./snapshot-raw -o ./observations
```

For data sources or resource types the built-in filters don't cover, you can write your own extractor in any language, or use an existing one such as `stave-extractor`. See [Building an Extractor](/docs/labs/building-extractors.md) for a jumpstart template.

## Step 3: Validate the observations[​](#step-3-validate-the-observations "Direct link to Step 3: Validate the observations")

Check that the extracted data is well-formed before evaluation.

```
stave validate --controls controls/s3 --observations ./observations
```

If validation fails, the error message tells you exactly which field is missing or malformed. Fix your extractor script (Step 2) and re-run it.

## Step 4: Apply built-in controls[​](#step-4-apply-built-in-controls "Direct link to Step 4: Apply built-in controls")

Run all 43 built-in S3 controls against your observations. This is where findings appear.

```
stave apply --controls controls/s3 --observations ./observations \
  --max-unsafe 168h --eval-time "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" --format text
```

Example output:

```
Evaluation Results
==================

Summary
-------
  Controls evaluated:  43
  Assets evaluated:    12
  Attack surface:      2
  Violations:          3

Violations
----------
  1. CTL.S3.CONTROLS.001
     Public Access Block Must Be Enabled
     Asset: res:aws:s3:bucket:staging-uploads
     Remediation: Enable BlockPublicAccess on this bucket.

  2. CTL.S3.ENCRYPT.002
     Transport Encryption Required
     Asset: res:aws:s3:bucket:staging-uploads
     Remediation: Add a bucket policy requiring ssl-only access.

  3. CTL.S3.LOG.001
     Access Logging Required
     Asset: res:aws:s3:bucket:staging-uploads
     Remediation: Enable server access logging.
```

You now have your first findings with specific remediation guidance.

## Step 5: Fix and verify[​](#step-5-fix-and-verify "Direct link to Step 5: Fix and verify")

Fix the issues in your AWS account, then take a second snapshot and re-evaluate.

```
# Fix the cloud config (e.g., enable BlockPublicAccess in AWS console or Terraform)

# Take a second snapshot
aws s3api get-public-access-block --bucket staging-uploads > snapshot-raw/staging-uploads-pab.json

# Re-run your extractor and re-evaluate
./my-s3-extractor.sh ./snapshot-raw ./observations
stave apply --controls controls/s3 --observations ./observations \
  --max-unsafe 168h --eval-time "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" --format text
```

If the fix worked, the finding disappears from the output. To formally verify:

```
# Save both evaluations
stave apply ... -f json > before.json   # (from Step 4)
stave apply ... -f json > after.json    # (after fix)
stave verify --before before.json --after after.json
```

## Step 6: Check status[​](#step-6-check-status "Direct link to Step 6: Check status")

See where you are in the workflow and what to do next:

```
stave status
```

## What if apply returns no findings?[​](#what-if-apply-returns-no-findings "Direct link to What if apply returns no findings?")

Your infrastructure might be clean, or the threshold might be too high. Run:

```
stave diagnose --controls controls/s3 --observations ./observations
```

This explains why findings did not trigger — threshold too high, time span too short, no predicate matches, or data shape issues.

## What if validate fails?[​](#what-if-validate-fails "Direct link to What if validate fails?")

The error tells you which field is missing or malformed. Common fixes:

* **Missing `captured_at`**: add a timestamp to your observation: `"captured_at": "2026-03-15T00:00:00Z"`
* **Schema mismatch**: ensure observations use `obs.v0.1` format — flat JSON, no `"snapshots"` wrapper

Fix your extractor script, re-run it, and validate again.

| Step | Command           | What happens                            |
| ---- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |

| 2    | Your extractor    | Normalize raw exports to observations   |
| 3    | `stave validate`  | Check observations are well-formed      |
| 4    | `stave apply`     | Evaluate 43 S3 controls, get findings   |
| 5    | Fix + re-snapshot | Remediate, retake snapshot, re-evaluate |
| 6    | `stave verify`    | Confirm the fix resolved the finding    |
