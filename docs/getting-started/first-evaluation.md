# Your First Stave Evaluation

No cloud credentials. No Steampipe. No setup. Evaluate a bundled example snapshot and read the result in about a minute.

Stave is a **risk reasoning engine**: it takes observation snapshots (JSON describing your cloud state) plus a catalog of controls, and produces deterministic verdicts. Same input → same output, every time. All evaluation is offline — no network, no credentials.

> **Environment:** The commands below assume a Coder workspace — `stave` on `$PATH`, examples at `~/examples/`. From a local clone (README Option 3) they work the same; just run from the repo root.

## Step 1: Clone and run (60 seconds)[​](#step-1-clone-and-run-60-seconds "Direct link to Step 1: Clone and run (60 seconds)")

```
git clone https://github.com/sufield/stave.git
cd stave
make build                              # builds ./stave (and syncs embedded data)
bash examples/demo-ai-security/run.sh
```

The demo evaluates a fixture AWS account with a Bedrock AI agent. It runs entirely against local JSON — `stave apply` exits `3` when it finds violations, which is expected here.

> Not set up for Go yet? `make build` needs Go 1.26+. Or install the binary directly: `go install github.com/sufield/stave/cmd/stave@latest` (then run the demo with `STAVE_BIN=$(go env GOPATH)/bin/stave bash examples/demo-ai-security/run.sh`).

## Step 2: Understand the output[​](#step-2-understand-the-output "Direct link to Step 2: Understand the output")

A Stave evaluation reports a **security state** for the snapshot:

| State           | Meaning                                                                                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `COMPLIANT`     | No violations. No approaching-threshold risk signals.                                          |
| `AT_RISK`       | No active violations, but at least one invariant is approaching its unsafe-duration threshold. |
| `NON_COMPLIANT` | At least one active violation — an invariant the snapshot breaks right now.                    |

Each **finding** is one control firing on one asset: a control ID (e.g. `CTL.S3.PUBLIC.001`), the asset, a severity, and the message.

**Chain findings** are Stave's distinctive output: a *compound* risk where several individually-acceptable conditions stack into an exploitable path. The demo fires three critical Bedrock chains — see [03-reading-chain-findings.md](/docs/getting-started/reading-chain-findings.md).

## Step 3: Evaluate your own snapshot[​](#step-3-evaluate-your-own-snapshot "Direct link to Step 3: Evaluate your own snapshot")

Point `apply` at a directory of `obs.v0.1` snapshot files:

```
stave apply --observations /path/to/your/obs/
stave apply --observations /path/to/your/obs/ --format json   # machine-readable
```

Exit codes: `0` = no violations · `2` = input error · `3` = violations found · `4` = internal error. Use `--eval-time 2026-01-15T00:00:00Z` to pin the clock for byte-identical, reproducible output.

Don't have snapshots yet? If you already run Steampipe, see [01-from-steampipe-to-stave.md](/docs/labs/from-steampipe-to-stave.md).

## Step 4: Use it from Claude Desktop (optional)[​](#step-4-use-it-from-claude-desktop-optional "Direct link to Step 4: Use it from Claude Desktop (optional)")

Stave ships an MCP server so an AI assistant can call it in conversation:

```
go install github.com/sufield/stave/cmd/mcp@latest
```

Add the config from `cmd/mcp/configs/claude-desktop.json` to your Claude Desktop config, then ask: *"Evaluate the snapshot in ./obs"* — the model calls the `stave.verify` tool and summarizes the result. See `cmd/mcp/README.md`.
