# What Stave Finds

This is real output from `stave apply` against a deliberately misconfigured AWS environment — a Bedrock AI agent with overpermissioned IAM roles, unencrypted patient data, and missing monitoring. Nothing is running. This is what the tool produces.

## Reading the output[​](#reading-the-output "Direct link to Reading the output")

### Compound chains — every precondition is present[​](#compound-chains--every-precondition-is-present "Direct link to Compound chains — every precondition is present")

```
Compound Chains: 11
  [critical] bedrock_agent_overpermissioned
  [critical] bedrock_agent_tool_phi_exposure
  [critical] bedrock_rag_phi_exposure
```

These are not individual misconfigurations. Each compound chain represents a multi-step attack path where every prerequisite is satisfied. `bedrock_agent_tool_phi_exposure` means: the agent has a tool (`patient-lookup-tool`) with access to a PHI data source (`patient-records`), the tool's Lambda role is overpermissioned, and there's no guardrail constraining what the agent can ask for. The path from "ask the agent a question" to "exfiltrate patient records" is open. Fix these first.

### Near-miss chains — one configuration change away[​](#near-miss-chains--one-configuration-change-away "Direct link to Near-miss chains — one configuration change away")

```
Near-Miss Chains: 59
  [critical] bedrock_agent_data_exfiltration — missing: CTL.BEDROCK.AGENT.GHOST.LAMBDA.001
```

One precondition in the attack chain is not yet present. The `missing:` field names the control that would need to fail for the chain to become exploitable. This is a leading indicator: protect the named control. If `BEDROCK.AGENT.GHOST.LAMBDA.001` starts failing (someone adds an unmonitored Lambda to the agent), this near-miss becomes a compound chain — the path opens.

### Standard findings — true misconfigurations[​](#standard-findings--true-misconfigurations "Direct link to Standard findings — true misconfigurations")

```
  58   high                    ENCRYPT.003                              patient-records
  59   high                    ENCRYPT.004                              patient-records
  60   high                    OWNERSHIP.001                            patient-records
```

Individual control violations without a connected attack path. `ENCRYPT.003` on `patient-records` means the S3 bucket holding patient data lacks server-side encryption. Real misconfiguration, real fix needed — but no compound chain amplifies it (yet).

### What's not in the output[​](#whats-not-in-the-output "Direct link to What's not in the output")

109 violations, 4 assets. If this environment had a fifth asset that passed every control, it would not appear in the findings. A clean result is a deliverable — it means the controls were evaluated and the configuration is compliant. Stave reports what it verified, not just what it found.
