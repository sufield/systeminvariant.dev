# GITHUB controls (22)

### CTL.GITHUB.ORG.MFA.001

**GitHub Organization MFA Not Required**

- **Severity:** critical
- **Type:** unsafe_state
- **Domain:** identity
- **Compliance:** nist_800_53_r5: IA-2; nist_ssdf: PO.1; pci_dss_v4: 8.3; soc2: CC6.1;

MFA not required for organization members. Compromised passwords give direct access to source code, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment workflows.

**Remediation:** Enable "Require two-factor authentication" in organization settings.

---

### CTL.GITHUB.ORG.PERMISSION.001

**Organization Default Repository Permission Too Broad**

- **Severity:** high
- **Type:** unsafe_state
- **Domain:** identity
- **Compliance:** nist_800_53_r5: AC-6; nist_ssdf: PO.1; soc2: CC6.1;

Default repository permission is "write" or "admin." Every member automatically gets write access to every new repository.

**Remediation:** Set default repository permission to "read" or "none."

---

### CTL.GITHUB.ORG.REPOCREATE.001

**Organization Allows All Members to Create Repositories**

- **Severity:** medium
- **Type:** unsafe_state
- **Domain:** identity
- **Compliance:** nist_800_53_r5: CM-5; soc2: CC6.1;

Any member can create repositories. Uncontrolled repository creation leads to sprawl and shadow repositories.

**Remediation:** Restrict repository creation to administrators.

---

### CTL.GITHUB.ORG.REPODELETE.001

**Organization Allows All Members to Delete Repositories**

- **Severity:** medium
- **Type:** unsafe_state
- **Domain:** exposure
- **Compliance:** nist_800_53_r5: CM-5; soc2: CC6.1;

Any member can delete repositories. A compromised account can destroy source code, CI/CD history, and release artifacts.

**Remediation:** Restrict repository deletion to administrators.

---

### CTL.GITHUB.ORG.VERIFIED.001

**Organization Domain Not Verified**

- **Severity:** low
- **Type:** unsafe_state
- **Domain:** identity
- **Compliance:** nist_800_53_r5: IA-9; soc2: CC6.1;

Organization domain not verified. GitHub cannot confirm the organization controls the domain it claims.

**Remediation:** Verify the organization's domain in GitHub settings.

---

### CTL.GITHUB.REPO.ADMINENFORCE.001

**Branch Protection Does Not Apply to Admins**

- **Severity:** high
- **Type:** unsafe_state
- **Domain:** identity
- **Compliance:** nist_800_53_r5: AC-6; nist_ssdf: PO.1; soc2: CC6.1;

Administrators exempt from branch protection. Admins can push directly, merge without approvals, and bypass status checks. Admin accounts are the highest-value targets.

**Remediation:** Enable "Do not allow bypassing the above settings" (include administrators).

---

### CTL.GITHUB.REPO.APPROVALS.001

**Default Branch Does Not Require Multiple Approvals**

- **Severity:** high
- **Type:** unsafe_state
- **Domain:** exposure
- **Compliance:** nist_800_53_r5: CM-3; nist_ssdf: PW.1; slsa: Level 3; soc2: CC8.1;

Branch protection requires fewer than 2 approvals. A single approval is a single point of failure in the review process.

**Remediation:** Set required approving reviews to 2 or more.

---

### CTL.GITHUB.REPO.BRANCHPROT.001

**Default Branch Protection Not Enabled**

- **Severity:** critical
- **Type:** unsafe_state
- **Domain:** exposure
- **Compliance:** nist_800_53_r5: CM-3; nist_ssdf: PW.1; pci_dss_v4: 6.3; slsa: Level 2; soc2: CC8.1;

No branch protection rules on the default branch. Anyone with write access can push directly — no code review, no CI checks, no approval required.

**Remediation:** Enable branch protection rules on the default branch.

---

### CTL.GITHUB.REPO.CODEOWNERS.001

**Default Branch Does Not Require CODEOWNERS Review**

- **Severity:** medium
- **Type:** unsafe_state
- **Domain:** exposure
- **Compliance:** nist_800_53_r5: CM-5; soc2: CC8.1;

CODEOWNERS review not required. Changes to critical files can be approved by any reviewer, not the designated code owners.

**Remediation:** Enable "Require review from Code Owners" in branch protection.

---

### CTL.GITHUB.REPO.CODEOWNERS.FILE.001

**Repository Missing CODEOWNERS File**

- **Severity:** medium
- **Type:** unsafe_state
- **Domain:** exposure
- **Compliance:** nist_800_53_r5: CM-5; nist_ssdf: PO.3; soc2: CC8.1;

No CODEOWNERS file. No defined ownership of code paths — any reviewer can approve changes to security-critical files.

**Remediation:** Create a CODEOWNERS file defining ownership of critical paths.

---

### CTL.GITHUB.REPO.DEPSCAN.001

**Repository Dependency Scanning Not Enabled**

- **Severity:** high
- **Type:** unsafe_state
- **Domain:** exposure
- **Compliance:** nist_800_53_r5: SI-2; nist_ssdf: PW.4; pci_dss_v4: 6.2; soc2: CC8.1;

Dependabot vulnerability scanning not enabled. Known CVEs in dependencies (Log4j, Spring4Shell, polyfill.io) are not detected.

**Remediation:** Enable Dependabot alerts and security updates.

---

### CTL.GITHUB.REPO.FORCEPUSH.001

**Default Branch Allows Force Push**

- **Severity:** high
- **Type:** unsafe_state
- **Domain:** exposure
- **Compliance:** nist_800_53_r5: CM-5; nist_ssdf: PS.1; soc2: CC8.1;

Force push allowed on the default branch. Force push rewrites git history — an attacker can remove evidence of previous commits and replace branch content entirely.

**Remediation:** Disable force push on the default branch in branch protection.

---

### CTL.GITHUB.REPO.GHOST.001

**CODEOWNERS References Deleted Team or User**

- **Severity:** medium
- **Type:** unsafe_state
- **Domain:** identity
- **Compliance:** nist_800_53_r5: AC-2; soc2: CC6.2;

CODEOWNERS file references a team or user that no longer exists. Code ownership assigned to a ghost — changes to the owned path have no actual reviewer.

**Remediation:** Update CODEOWNERS to reference existing teams and users.

---

### CTL.GITHUB.REPO.IMMUTABLE.001

**Repository Immutable Releases Not Enabled**

- **Severity:** high
- **Type:** unsafe_state
- **Domain:** exposure
- **Compliance:** nist_800_53_r5: SI-7; nist_ssdf: PS.2; slsa: Level 3; soc2: CC8.1;

Published releases can be modified after publication. An attacker can replace release artifacts with malicious versions under the same version identifier.

**Remediation:** Enable immutable releases (tag protection + release locking).

---

### CTL.GITHUB.REPO.INACTIVE.001

**Inactive Repository Not Archived**

- **Severity:** medium
- **Type:** unsafe_state
- **Domain:** exposure
- **Compliance:** nist_800_53_r5: CM-3; soc2: CC8.1;

No commits in 90+ days and not archived. Dependencies accumulate CVEs, secrets remain unrotated, and the codebase drifts from current security practices.

**Remediation:** Archive the repository or resume active maintenance.

---

### CTL.GITHUB.REPO.LINEARHISTORY.001

**Default Branch Does Not Require Linear History**

- **Severity:** low
- **Type:** unsafe_state
- **Domain:** exposure
- **Compliance:** nist_800_53_r5: CM-3; soc2: CC8.1;

Merge commits allowed. Linear history (rebase/squash only) makes git history easier to audit and harder to hide malicious commits.

**Remediation:** Enable "Require linear history" in branch protection.

---

### CTL.GITHUB.REPO.SECRETSCAN.001

**Repository Secret Scanning Not Enabled**

- **Severity:** critical
- **Type:** unsafe_state
- **Domain:** exposure
- **Compliance:** nist_800_53_r5: SA-11; nist_ssdf: PW.7; pci_dss_v4: 6.5; soc2: CC8.1;

Secret scanning not enabled. Committed credentials (API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys) are not detected. Secrets in git history persist forever.

**Remediation:** Enable secret scanning in repository security settings.

---

### CTL.GITHUB.REPO.SECRETSCAN.PUSH.001

**Secret Scanning Push Protection Not Enabled**

- **Severity:** high
- **Type:** unsafe_state
- **Domain:** exposure
- **Compliance:** nist_800_53_r5: SA-11; nist_ssdf: PW.7; soc2: CC8.1;

Push protection disabled. Secrets detected after commit, not blocked before. The credential enters git history before detection and must be rotated.

**Remediation:** Enable push protection in secret scanning settings.

---

### CTL.GITHUB.REPO.SECURITYMD.001

**Public Repository Missing SECURITY.md File**

- **Severity:** medium
- **Type:** unsafe_state
- **Domain:** exposure
- **Compliance:** nist_800_53_r5: SA-11; nist_ssdf: RV.1; soc2: CC8.1;

Public repository has no SECURITY.md. No vulnerability disclosure process defined for security researchers.

**Remediation:** Create a SECURITY.md file with vulnerability reporting instructions.

---

### CTL.GITHUB.REPO.SIGNED.001

**Default Branch Does Not Require Signed Commits**

- **Severity:** medium
- **Type:** unsafe_state
- **Domain:** identity
- **Compliance:** nist_800_53_r5: SI-7; nist_ssdf: PS.1; soc2: CC8.1;

Commits not required to be GPG or SSH signed. Commit authorship can be spoofed — an attacker can create commits appearing to come from a trusted developer.

**Remediation:** Enable "Require signed commits" in branch protection.

---

### CTL.GITHUB.REPO.STALEREVIEWS.001

**Default Branch Does Not Dismiss Stale Reviews**

- **Severity:** high
- **Type:** unsafe_state
- **Domain:** exposure
- **Compliance:** nist_800_53_r5: CM-3; nist_ssdf: PW.1; soc2: CC8.1;

Approvals not dismissed when new commits are pushed. An attacker can get a benign PR approved, then push malicious commits after approval. The PR merges with stale approval covering different code.

**Remediation:** Enable "Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed."

---

### CTL.GITHUB.REPO.STATUSCHECKS.001

**Default Branch Does Not Require Status Checks**

- **Severity:** high
- **Type:** unsafe_state
- **Domain:** exposure
- **Compliance:** nist_800_53_r5: SA-11; nist_ssdf: PW.1; pci_dss_v4: 6.5; soc2: CC8.1;

CI status checks not required before merging. Code merges even when tests fail, security scans flag issues, or linting detects problems.

**Remediation:** Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging."
