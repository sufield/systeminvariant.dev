# S3 Assessment Workflow

This is the supported S3 MVP workflow for the current CLI surface.

## Golden Path

```text
extract (external) -> validate -> apply -> verify
```

## 1) Extract observations from an offline AWS snapshot

Use an extractor (any language) to produce `obs.v0.1` JSON from your AWS snapshot directory. See [Building an Extractor](../integration/building-extractors.md) for a jumpstart template, or use an existing extractor such as `stave-extractor`.

Input:
- Snapshot directory with AWS CLI exports (`list-buckets.json`, `get-bucket-*` files)

Output:
- `observations.json` (`obs.v0.1`)

## 2) Evaluate observations against the S3 control pack

```bash
stave apply --profile aws-s3 --input observations.json --include-all --eval-time 2026-01-15T00:00:00Z > evaluation.json
```

Input:
- `observations.json`
- Built-in S3 controls under `controls/s3`

Output:
- `evaluation.json` (`out.v0.1`)
- Exit code `3` when violations are found

## 3) Verify remediation (before vs after)

```bash
stave check \
  --before ./obs-before \
  --after ./obs-after \
  --controls ./controls/s3 \
  --eval-time 2026-01-15T00:00:00Z \
  --out ./output
```

Input:
- Before/after observations directories
- Controls directory

Output:
- stdout JSON verification summary
- `output/verification.json` when `--out` is set

## Optional: generate enforcement templates

From an `out.v0.1` evaluation file, `stave enforce` produces deterministic
remediation artifacts — either Public Access Block Terraform or a Service
Control Policy:

```bash
# Public Access Block (Terraform)
stave enforce --in evaluation.json --out ./output --mode pab

# Service Control Policy (JSON)
stave enforce --in evaluation.json --out ./output --mode scp
```

Output:
- PAB mode: `output/enforcement/aws/pab.tf`
- SCP mode: `output/enforcement/aws/scp.json`

## What the S3 pack covers

The `aws-s3` profile evaluates 67 controls across these categories:

| Category | Controls | What they detect |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Public exposure | PUBLIC.001–008, PUBLIC.LIST, PUBLIC.PREFIX | Public read, list, write via policy or ACL |
| ACL misconfiguration | ACL.ESCALATION, ACL.FULLCONTROL, ACL.RECON, ACL.WRITE, ACL.OBJECT | Bucket and object-level ACL grants |
| Access control | ACCESS.001–003, AUTH.READ, AUTH.WRITE, PRESIGNED, ACCESS.GRANTS | Cross-account, wildcard actions, presigned URLs |
| Encryption | ENCRYPT.001–004 | At-rest, in-transit, KMS for PHI/sensitive data |
| Block Public Access | CONTROLS.001, ACCOUNT.PAB.001 | Bucket-level and account-level PAB |
| Object Ownership | OWNERSHIP.001 | BucketOwnerEnforced to disable ACLs |
| Logging & audit | LOG.001, AUDIT.OBJECTLEVEL.001 | Server access logging, CloudTrail object-level |
| Sensitive data discovery | DETECT.MACIE.001–002 | Macie enablement, automated discovery |
| Versioning & integrity | VERSION.001–002, MFADELETE.001, LOCK.001–003 | Versioning, MFA delete, Object Lock |
| Replication | REPLICATION.001–003 | Replication enabled, cross-region, destination encrypted |
| Lifecycle & retention | LIFECYCLE.001–002 | Lifecycle rules, PHI minimum retention |
| Visibility | INVENTORY.001 | S3 Inventory for bucket content auditing |
| Governance | GOVERNANCE.001, REGION.001 | Data classification tags, approved regions |
| Network | NETWORK.001, NETWORK.POLICY.001, NETWORK.VPC.001, MRAP.* | VPC endpoints, MRAP policies |
| CDN & takeover | CDN.OAC.001, CDN.EXPOSURE.001, BUCKET.TAKEOVER.001, DANGLING.ORIGIN.001 | CloudFront OAC, dangling origins |
| Write scope | WRITE.SCOPE.001, WRITE.CONTENT.001 | Signed upload key/content-type binding |
| Tenant isolation | TENANT.ISOLATION.001 | Prefix-scoped multi-tenant access |
| Vendor delegation | DELEGATION.{KNOWN,SCOPE,LIFECYCLE,REVOCABLE,ESCALATION}.001 | Supply-chain governance of external principals with control rights |

## Vendor delegation governance

Five controls under `controls/s3/delegation/` plus one compound
chain detect the "your bucket has an owner, the vendor has
control" pattern — risk transferred to a weaker party without
safety continuity.

| Control | Detects |
|---|---|
| `CTL.S3.DELEGATION.KNOWN.001` | External principal not in `controldata/taxonomy/vendor_registry.yaml` |
| `CTL.S3.DELEGATION.SCOPE.001` | Actual permissions exceed the vendor's declared scope |
| `CTL.S3.DELEGATION.LIFECYCLE.001` | Vendor `review_date` in the past |
| `CTL.S3.DELEGATION.REVOCABLE.001` | Customer cannot unilaterally revoke vendor access |
| `CTL.S3.DELEGATION.ESCALATION.001` | Vendor can make bucket public (PutBucketPolicy / PutBucketAcl) |

Compound chain: `delegated_control_failure` — threshold 3 of 5,
CRITICAL. Complementary to `vendor_attack_path` (confused-deputy);
same bucket can fire both.

The collector populates `properties.delegation.*` booleans by
comparing the bucket policy against `vendor_registry.yaml`.
Single-snapshot detection: the predicates fire whether a
declaration was removed yesterday or never applied.

Worked demo: `examples/s3-delegation-failure/run.sh`. See
`examples/s3-delegation-failure/multi-engine-results.md` for
CEL + chain + Clingo + Soufflé output. The Soufflé program
`examples/souffle-reachability/delegation-reach.dl` enumerates
per-principal `excessive_reach` rows and counts; the Clingo
rules in `examples/clingo-constraints/ai-delegation-shadow.lp`
name every (bucket, principal, reason) triple.

## Notes

- Offline by design: reads local files only.
- Deterministic in CI: always set `--eval-time`.
- For troubleshooting unexpected results, run `stave diagnose`.
