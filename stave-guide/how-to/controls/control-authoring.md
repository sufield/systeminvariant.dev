# Authoring Controls

This guide explains how to create new security controls for Stave. Controls are
declarative YAML — no Go code required. The evaluation engine handles any asset
type and any cloud vendor without code changes.

## Why a control is data, not code

The engineer who configures an S3 bucket correctly on day one
is the same engineer who, six months later, has moved teams. A
new engineer debugs a cross-account access issue, temporarily
adds a permissive policy, the application works, the tests
pass, the deploy succeeds. Nobody catches the regression
because the original engineer's intent — "this bucket must
never be publicly accessible" — was never written down in a
way the system could enforce. It lived in their head, maybe
in a Confluence page nobody reads, maybe in a Slack message
buried under thousands of others.

Terraform manages the bucket's configuration. OPA can check
individual resource properties. But none of these express the
safety property: "regardless of what changes, regardless of
who changes it, regardless of which tool makes the change —
this condition must never be violated." That's a system
invariant. A Stave control is how you write one.

### Liveness vs safety

Borrowed from distributed systems theory:

- **Liveness** properties say what should *eventually* happen
  ("the system should converge to the desired state"). Terraform
  and Pulumi express liveness.
- **Safety** properties say what must *never* happen ("no
  bucket tagged PHI is ever publicly readable"). That's a
  Stave control.

A liveness violation is self-correcting (Terraform detects
drift, reapplies). A safety violation can be invisible —
every resource matches its desired state, Terraform shows no
changes, and yet a security property is violated because the
desired configuration itself is wrong.

### Why YAML, not Python or Go

Most security tools embed their checks as code. A Prowler
check is a Python function. A Checkov check is Python with
graph queries. A Trivy check is Rego. The consequences:

- Understanding what a check does requires reading code in a
  specific language.
- Extending the tool requires programming in that language.
- Auditing the check requires a developer, not a security
  analyst.

Stave's controls are YAML with a constrained DSL. A
compliance officer can read
`field: properties.storage.encryption.at_rest_enabled, op: eq, value: false`
and understand "this fires when encryption is off." They
can't read a Python function that does the same thing. The
contract is the documentation.

Three properties follow from controls-as-data:

1. **Readable by non-developers** — compliance officers,
   CTOs, auditors can read the YAML.
2. **Composable and introspectable** — you can enumerate all
   controls programmatically, generate compliance matrices
   automatically, diff control sets between versions, detect
   conflicting controls. These operations are trivial on
   structured YAML and nearly impossible when checks are
   scattered across code files.
3. **No side effects** — a Python check could accidentally
   call an API, modify state, introduce a dependency, fail
   for reasons unrelated to the security property it's
   checking. A control reads data and returns a verdict. The
   constraint is the guarantee.

The DSL deliberately *cannot* call external services, execute
arbitrary code, or modify state. A control is a pure
assertion: read data, return true or false. That constraint
is what makes controls auditable — a compliance officer can
read the YAML and know exactly what it checks without
worrying about side effects.

## Quick Start: Policy Forge

The fastest way to create a new control with test fixtures:

```bash
make gencontrol \
  ID=CTL.S3.EXAMPLE.001 \
  NAME="Example Safety Check" \
  DOMAIN=exposure \
  SEVERITY=high \
  SCOPE_TAGS=aws,s3 \
  ASSET_TYPE=aws_s3_bucket \
  KIND=bucket \
  FIELD=properties.storage.access.public_read \
  OP=eq \
  VALUE=true \
  REMEDIATION="Enable S3 Public Access Block."
```

This generates:
- A validated ctrl.v1 YAML control definition
- A **fail** fixture (observations that trigger the finding, expected exit 3)
- A **pass** fixture (observations that do not trigger, expected exit 0)

Then generate golden files and run tests:

```bash
make regenerate-goldens
make e2e
```

## Folder Layout

Controls are organized by domain and category:

```
controls/
├── s3/                  # AWS S3 storage (67 controls)
├── iam/                 # AWS IAM identity (21 controls)
├── cloudwatch/          # AWS CloudWatch (17 controls)
├── rds/                 # AWS RDS (10 controls)
├── cloudtrail/          # AWS CloudTrail (7 controls)
├── vpc/                 # AWS VPC (7 controls)
├── gcs/                 # GCP Cloud Storage (7 controls)

├── sqs/                 # AWS SQS (3 controls)
├── sns/                 # AWS SNS (2 controls)
├── cloudformation/      # AWS CloudFormation (2 controls)
├── guardduty/           # AWS GuardDuty (2 controls)
├── securityhub/         # AWS Security Hub (2 controls)
├── autoscaling/         # AWS Auto Scaling (2 controls)
├── route53/             # AWS Route 53 (2 controls)
├── cognito/             # AWS Cognito (2 controls)
├── elasticache/         # AWS ElastiCache (2 controls)
└── apigateway/          # AWS API Gateway (2 controls)
```

Place new controls in the appropriate domain and category. Create a new
domain directory if no existing domain fits.

## Adding a New Domain

When adding controls for a new service or cloud provider:

1. Create `controls/{domain}/{category}/` directories
2. Document the property namespace in `docs/contract/README.md`
3. Add an INCOMPLETE control for missing extractor data
4. Update `internal/controldata/embed.go` with the new glob
5. Add pack and control entries to `internal/builtin/pack/embedded/index.yaml`
6. Optionally register a profile in `cmd/apply/profile.go`
7. Run `make sync-controls && make readme && make docs-controls`

Zero engine changes required. See AGENTS.md for the full checklist.

## ID Convention

```
CTL.<DOMAIN>.<CATEGORY>.<SEQ>
```

- **DOMAIN**: Service identifier (`S3`, `IAM`, `GCS`, `DNS`)
- **CATEGORY**: What it checks (`PUBLIC`, `ENCRYPT`, `ROOT`, `DANGLING`)
- **SEQ**: Three-digit sequence number (`001`, `002`, etc.)

Multi-segment categories are allowed: `CTL.S3.PUBLIC.PREFIX.001`,
`CTL.IAM.ROOT.MFA.001`, `CTL.DNS.DANGLING.001`.

The ID must match: `^CTL\.[A-Z0-9]+\.[A-Z0-9]+(\.[A-Z0-9]+)*\.[0-9]+$`

## Control Structure

```yaml
dsl_version: ctrl.v1
id: CTL.S3.EXAMPLE.001
name: Example Safety Check
description: >
  Buckets must not have public read access enabled.
domain: exposure
severity: high
compliance:
  cis_aws_v1.4.0: "2.1.5"
  hipaa: "164.312(a)(1)"
scope_tags:
  - aws
  - s3
type: unsafe_state
params: {}
remediation:
  description: >
    Bucket has public read access. Anyone can download objects.
  action: >
    Enable S3 Public Access Block (all four settings).
  example: |
    {
      "storage": {
        "access": { "public_read": false }
      }
    }
unsafe_predicate:
  all:
    - field: properties.storage.kind
      op: eq
      value: bucket
    - field: properties.storage.access.public_read
      op: eq
      value: true
```

### Required fields

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `dsl_version` | Must be `ctrl.v1` |
| `id` | Unique control identifier |
| `name` | Short human-readable name |
| `description` | What the control detects and why it matters |
| `type` | Control type (see below) |
| `unsafe_predicate` | YAML predicate defining the unsafe condition |

### Recommended fields

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `domain` | Grouping label (`exposure`, `identity`, `storage`) |
| `severity` | `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `info` |
| `scope_tags` | Array of tags for filtering (`aws`, `s3`, `gcp`, `dns`) |
| `compliance` | Framework mappings (`hipaa`, `cis_aws_v1.4.0`, `pci_dss_v3.2.1`) |
| `remediation` | Description, action, and example for fixing the finding |

## Operator Reference

| Operator | What it does | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `eq` | Equality check | `{field: ..., op: eq, value: true}` |
| `ne` | Not equal (missing fields match) | `{field: ..., op: ne, value: "aws:kms"}` |
| `gt` | Greater than (numeric) | `{field: ..., op: gt, value: 10}` |
| `lt` | Less than (numeric) | `{field: ..., op: lt, value: 14}` |
| `gte` | Greater than or equal | `{field: ..., op: gte, value: 2190}` |
| `lte` | Less than or equal | `{field: ..., op: lte, value: 90}` |
| `in` | Value in list | `{field: ..., op: in, value: [PII, PHI]}` |
| `missing` | Field absent/nil/empty | `{field: ..., op: missing, value: true}` |
| `present` | Field exists and non-empty | `{field: ..., op: present, value: true}` |
| `contains` | Substring match | `{field: ..., op: contains, value: "enforce_prefix=false"}` |
| `any_match` | Nested predicate over array | See [Array matching](#array-matching-identity-iteration) |
| `neq_field` | Two fields not equal | `{field: ..., op: neq_field, value: ...}` |
| `not_in_field` | Value not in another field's list | `{field: ..., op: not_in_field, value: ...}` |
| `list_empty` | List is empty or nil | `{field: ..., op: list_empty, value: true}` |
| `not_subset_of_field` | List has elements not in another | `{field: ..., op: not_subset_of_field, value: ...}` |

**Notes:**
- Missing fields do **not** match `eq false`. Only explicitly set `false` triggers `eq false`.
- Missing fields **do** match `ne "value"`. Absence counts as "not equal."

## Common Patterns

### Boolean state check

```yaml
unsafe_predicate:
  any:
    - field: properties.storage.access.public_read
      op: eq
      value: true
```

### Kind discriminator + property check

Most controls start with a `kind` check to scope the predicate to the right
asset subtype. The Policy Forge generates this automatically with `--kind`.

```yaml
unsafe_predicate:
  all:
    - field: properties.identity.kind
      op: eq
      value: user
    - field: properties.identity.console_access.mfa_enabled
      op: eq
      value: false
```

### Nested `any` inside `all` (compound condition)

```yaml
unsafe_predicate:
  all:
    - field: properties.identity.kind
      op: eq
      value: password_policy
    - any:
        - field: properties.identity.password_policy.require_uppercase
          op: eq
          value: false
        - field: properties.identity.password_policy.require_symbols
          op: eq
          value: false
```

### Data classification + access check

```yaml
unsafe_predicate:
  all:
    - any:
        - field: properties.storage.access.public_read
          op: eq
          value: true
    - any:
        - field: properties.storage.tags.data-classification
          op: eq
          value: confidential
        - field: properties.storage.tags.data-classification
          op: eq
          value: phi
```

### Array matching (identity iteration)

Use `any_match` to evaluate a nested predicate against each element of an
array field (e.g., identities):

```yaml
unsafe_predicate:
  all:
    - field: properties.storage.tags.tenant_mode
      op: eq
      value: shared
    - field: identities
      op: any_match
      value:
        all:
          - field: type
            op: eq
            value: app_signer
          - field: purpose
            op: contains
            value: "allow_traversal=true"
```

### Vendor-agnostic controls

DNS controls work regardless of DNS provider. The `vendor` field is metadata —
controls evaluate `properties.dns.*` paths only:

```yaml
unsafe_predicate:
  any:
    - field: properties.dns.target_exists
      op: eq
      value: false
    - field: properties.dns.target_owned
      op: eq
      value: false
```

## Control Types

| Type | When to use |
|------|------------|
| `unsafe_state` | Violation when predicate matches in any snapshot. Most common. |
| `unsafe_duration` | Violation when asset is unsafe longer than `--max-unsafe`. |
| `prefix_exposure` | Violation when protected prefixes are publicly readable. |
| `unsafe_recurrence` | Violation when exposure window count exceeds limit within window. |

For `unsafe_duration`, set a per-control threshold to override `--max-unsafe`:

```yaml
type: unsafe_duration
params:
  max_unsafe_duration: "0h"   # zero tolerance — immediate violation
```

## Property Namespaces

Each domain uses its own namespace. See `docs/contract/README.md` for the
full field dictionary.

| Domain | Namespace | Discriminator |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| S3 | `properties.storage.*` | `storage.kind: "bucket"` |
| IAM | `properties.identity.*` | `identity.kind: "account"/"user"/"password_policy"` |
| GCS | `properties.storage.*` | `storage.kind: "bucket"` (shared with S3 where semantics align) |
| DNS | `properties.dns.*` | — (vendor-agnostic) |

## Testing Your Control

### Using the Policy Forge (recommended)

```bash
# Generate control + pass/fail fixtures
make gencontrol ID=CTL.S3.NEW.001 NAME="My Control" \
  FIELD=properties.storage.access.public_read \
  REMEDIATION="Disable public read."

# Generate golden expected output
make regenerate-goldens

# Run all E2E tests including the new fixture
make e2e
```

### Manual testing

```bash
# Validate schema
stave validate --in controls/s3/example/CTL.S3.EXAMPLE.001.yaml

# Evaluate against test observations
stave apply \
  --controls controls/s3/example/ \
  --observations test-observations/ \
  --eval-time 2026-01-02T00:00:00Z

# Trace evaluation logic step by step
stave apply \
  --controls controls/s3/example/ \
  --observations test-observations/ \
  --eval-time 2026-01-02T00:00:00Z \
  --trace trace.json
```

## Review Checklist

Before submitting a new control:

- [ ] ID follows `CTL.<DOMAIN>.<CATEGORY>.<SEQ>` pattern
- [ ] `dsl_version` is `ctrl.v1`
- [ ] `name` and `description` are clear and specific
- [ ] `remediation.action` explains how to fix (required — every control must have a remediation path)
- [ ] `severity` is set
- [ ] `scope_tags` include domain and vendor tags

- [ ] Control passes `stave validate`
- [ ] Pass and fail test fixtures exist
- [ ] Golden-file output committed for regression testing
- [ ] Property namespace documented in `docs/contract/README.md`
- [ ] INCOMPLETE control exists for the domain

## Build Integration

After adding controls:

```bash
make sync-controls      # Copy to embedded directory
make build              # Rebuild binary with new controls
make docs-controls      # Regenerate control reference
make readme             # Update README with control counts
make e2e                # Verify all tests pass
```
